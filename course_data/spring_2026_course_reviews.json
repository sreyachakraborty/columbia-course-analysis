After I got the basic principles in my head though, it went much better, and I did well starting from the midterms. I never showed up to the lectures in person, personally found it much more helpful to rewatch the recordings at 2x speed, coding along, pausing and replaying parts at my own pace. Lecture content feels a little disjointed at first, not always clear how everything connects, so you do need to read and do! the! ZyBooks! Not gonna lie though, this course would've taken me a lot longer if it weren't for me basically using GPT4 as an on demand tutor/TA, helping explain to me textbook and lecture content, as well as providing more practice questions. \n\nOverall still a good course.

Its more like he codes and talks. Honestly, I did not find it helpful to go to lecture because of this. I found it a better use of my time to just learn Java on my own. \n\nThe homeworks do progressively get harder and more time consuming, so my advice is to start early and go to TA OH. Some TAs are better than others imo cuz some of them would not even know what the assignment is about while others were more prepared to answer questions, so find out which TAs work better for you. Also, check EDStem while doing HW, because often the HW instructions are not very specific and there will be new requirements that are not mentioned in the HW instructions that you only find out about because someone else asked about it on ED Stem.\n\nI do like that Blaer tells you what topics are going to be on the exam before hand so that you know what to really drill down for the exam. I only went to Blaer's OH one time, and he was lowkey condescending. I asked my question in a respectful manner so I think the rudeness was uncalled for.  If many people are saying hes unapproachable then I doubt this was just a one time thing. \n\nGrading for this class is chill though, its curved well. I ended up with an A w a raw of 92.

I would only take this course if you are seriously interested in majoring/minoring in CS - it is not just an elective you can push off to the side. I took COMS1004 to see if I wanted to major in CS and realized it wasn't for me, so the last couple of months were a pain to get through because the homework gets harder and harder. Honesty, everything after the midterm dramatically increased in difficulty. I also found the homework to be inordinately difficult compared to the exams. Expect to spend 5-10 hours on each homework, probably more on the Poker assignment. \n\nBlaer is a very charismatic and enjoyable lecturer. However, if you are someone who doesn't know what is going on, it's easy to get confused because he incorporates jargon that we learned in class into his explanations. If you don't understand a previous concept, MAKE SURE you figure it out asap.\n\nAs someone who got an A and was incredibly confused half of the semester, my best advice is to 1) Start HW early and go to office hours for help. There are lots of TAs so I'd suggest going to different ones and figuring out which TAs you like; 2) Actually read the Zybooks and make sure you know how to do all of the problems. For greater understanding, do the challenge problems; 3) Go to the review sessions and study everything he says for the midterm/final. I found YouTube and previous lectures/HWs to be helpful. Final and midterm are similarly structured, and if you're confused start with memorizing the syntax of the algorithms he covers (binary search, linear search, max/min, selection/insertion sort).\n\nI took ESP and that was a super chill, surface-level introduction to CS concepts.",

He is not bad at explaining concepts, but there are no slides or complementary notes for most coding lectures and therefore the learning process feels unstructured. The strategy is to make your own notes with the recordings after class, because it's hard to make a structured notes in class when you don't know where he's going. I however did not realize this early on and did not make my own notes.

Despite having prior Computer Science experience, I learned so much about Java in this course. Professor Cannon really tries to help his students learn and complete the assignments. For example, for Assignment #8, which was the Crazy Eights game and the hardest assignment in the course, Professor Cannon made a review video and session to help us with the assignment. He also gave every student in my section a 48-hour extension on that assignment. Professor Cannon is also always open to feedback from students. During the class before the second Midterm, he initially planned to help us with the Deck class of the Crazy Eights game, but after listening to students about their worries regarding the Midterm, he decided to answer students' questions instead. I, as well as my classmates, will admit that Professor Cannon gives challenging assignments. However, Professor Cannon and the TAs, especially Griffin Newbold (he TAs for Cannon in Computing in Content and for his Intro Java course), enjoy helping students and answering their questions both on Ed Discussion and during office hours. I worked very hard on the assignments regardless of their difficulty, and as a result, I learned a lot about Java from Professor Cannon's challenging assignments. The challenge of his course allows students to learn a lot and be amazing programmers. Despite challenging his students, Professor Cannon is never demanding, unkind, or condescending. He cares much more about his students learning and becoming excellent programmers than about their grades. The Final Exam had a 67.8% average, but since the class average grade at the end of the semester was less than the high B cutoff, Professor Cannon curved his students' grades to a high B. Don't worry! Professor Cannon does not want his students to fail, and he never curves down; instead, as I said, he is concerned about his students learning, not about their grades. After each of our Midterms, he even told his students in lecture that if they do not get good grades in tests, they are not bad people :)",

Both Midterms consisted of 30 multiple choice questions. If you are good at Computer Science, work hard in the class, and are not a bad test taker, you will probably pass the Midterms or even do great on them. The averages for Midterms were late 70% to early 80%. The Final Exam had multiple choice questions, short answer questions (they only require you to write a word or a line of code), and coding questions. Professor Cannon made the Final Exam more challenging than the Midterms (I am assuming from my personal experience that most of the challenge was in the coding portion). The class average for the Final Exam was 67.8%, but Professor Cannon curved to a high B. Make sure you study hard for the Final Exam and try your best on it to really benefit from the curve.\n\nProfessor Cannon's grading is only somewhat fair. I think the TAs applied the style guide quite harshly when grading the programming assignments, to the point that the grading seemed untransparent to me. There were guidelines students can easily apply from the style guide with minimal or no mistakes; however, the TAs sometimes gave students a grade deduction for something that pertains to style but was not fully explained by them and Professor Cannon. For example, I once received a style guide violation for writing excessive comments, but Professor Cannon and the TAs did not fully explain to me in advance how to write good comments. They did tell us numerous times to write comments in our code.\n\nOn average, I spent four to thirty hours per week on assignments for this course. The amount of time I spent on the assignments varied based on their difficulty. I found Homeworks 8 and 9 to be incredibly challenging, so I spent immense time on them (around thirty hours). On the other hand, a few assignments were simple and easier, so I did not have to spend as much time on them. I spent a few hours studying for each Midterm Exam, but I almost always joined the weekly review sessions. To clarify, I mean, apart from the weekly review sessions, I spent a few hours watching other recorded review sessions, asking questions on Ed Discussion and in TAs' office hours, and reviewing my notes and code from class. My scores on Midterms 1 and 2 were 26/30 and 27/30, respectively. On the first Midterm, which was online and all multiple-choice, I accidentally clicked the wrong answer choice, so I would say I really earned 27/30. I studied around fourteen hours for the Final Exam, and this also includes the Final Exam review session a few TAs hosted. My grade on the Final Exam was 81%, which is greater than the class average and two points less than the upper quartile, but the Final Exam was harder than the Midterms.\n\nMy final grade in the class was 90.6% or an A!"

I had taken 1006 in the semester before I took 1004 and I LOVED it... my logic was \"omg 1006 was so much fun and I learned a lot with great projects and other assignments so I bet 1004 will be just as helpful and I'm going to learn a lot in java!!!\" yeah no. At the beginning the problem sets and programming projects were very easy (which I expected and I'm sure people who were taking this as their first CS class appreciated). But like after the first couple of assignments, the projects just got really repetitive and some of them were dumb hard for an introductory level course. Also Codio is the worst IDE. Why they use it, I have no idea.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is, that I feel like I barely know anything about java. The only thing I took away from this class is that java uses a lot of semi-colons and brackets? I guess I learned a little bit about the internet and Von Neumann architecture? \r\n\r\nThe midterm was straightforward I guess, as was the final (but I took this class during the corona semester so idk what the real final would have looked like).\r\n\r\nTLDR; if you're not a CS major and just want a fun intro class, take 1006 or 1002. This class is a lot of work with no reward. I spent an entire semester in the class and I still barely know any java. I used guess and check for the projects (like I would write the code that I think would work, check if it complied, look for the errors which were usually pretty minor syntax errors)",

I took AP CS, so the content of the class wasn't that difficult, though there are things to learn even if you did take AP CS, like Turing machines, Dijkstra's algorithm, exception handling, von Neumann architecture, and information about the layers of computer networks. (If you know all of that and took AP CS you could potentially skip to Data Structures, though it was nice to be able to review everything I already knew to really get a firm grip on the material.) I could see the class being a little difficult for people going in with no experience as he doesn't really explain the syntax in depth and you probably will need to do a fair about of self teaching, but conceptually he does a great job explaining everything. I found the midterm and final pretty easy. They were mostly definitions and multiple choice and the final had coding and short answer. Just make sure you pay attention during lecture to all the details. He actually does tell you the answers to some of the harder questions during class. I also really appreciated his organization. Problem sets and projects come out on a timely basis each week. He often codes live for you as well and sends you the code that is done is class, which is helpful. ",

Problem sets are a bit of a struggle, exams are reasonable.\r\n\r\nBlaer's a fun guy. He's down-to-earth and isn't pretentious. Expect a lot of tangential stories though. There are a lot of TAs, and they're for the most part helpful. Recitation is usually staged more of an OH though, they take questions & don't really have a set plan. You must go to the first recitation--that's when they go through how to set up pico so you can actually code, and it's a million times easier seeing them do it in front of you than trying to read the tutorial.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me and go into the class w/o knowing any compsci, you're going to spend the first few classes going \"what the FUCK is going on.\" Be good about reviewing notes and reading the textbook though (and doing a lot of googling), and eventually you'll catch up.\r\n\r\nBefore each exam he'll usually go over what will be tested. Make sure to go to at least one of the TA's review sessions--they'll usually cover something a little more comprehensively than Blaer. Exams are decent. Often I just read & reread the textbook and that was enough. The final covered way more content, but to make up for it it was also easier. \r\n\r\nAlso, use Piazza religiously. Questions are almost immediately answered and any question you might have will probably already be up there.\r\n\r\nAn A is definitely doable, no matter your past experience; you're going to have to put in some work & effort though.",

If this is your very first exposure to computer science, be forewarned that this is a challenging class. It will be much more rigorous than most likely any other introductory course in other fields. That being said, if you put in the effort, this class is very doable. You will be spending hours studying, as it requires learning both a language (java) and a general science (CS theory). If you do you not intend to be a computer science major, I would suggest taking a different course that involves coding (like a applications course that teaches Python with another subject, or a coding course for nonmajors). If you do take this course, be prepared to do a lot of googling & research on your own to figure out how Java works. It would really help you to do some basic tutorials to get the gist of it before you head into the first lecture. \r\n\r\nBlaer is an excellent professor, and his explanatory style is very clear and concise. He gets very distracted in his lectures, and it's pretty hilarious and adorable--which always made them a pleasure to attend. His expectations for tests and homeworks are always very clear. He does, however, have a tendency to underemphasize how difficult/important topics will be. For example, when listing topics to go over on test, if he mentions something in passing, you should know it pretty much backwards and forwards. Another example, the second to last homework we used a hashmaps, FileReaders, and PrinterWriters--all of which he probably talked about for like two seconds and never explained. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TAs are beautiful, wonderful human beings. James Lin the head TA/(and I quote) \"aspiring Little League Coach\" is the best thing to happen to 1004 probably ever, and he was very encouraging and generally super kind in all his emails and communications. They are all very helpful, just be sure to find one who you get along with and remember their office hours (there are like a 11 TAs, and like always office hours). Piazza is also a great resource, with under 15 min response times. Usually all of my questions were already answered there before I even needed to ask anyone. ",

                "content": "I imagine this class would be very difficult to succeed in with no programming background.  I took AP Computer Science in high school, so I expected Cannon's class to be cake.  However, it still did require a good deal of effort and I felt appropriately challenged throughout the semester.  As past reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve is pretty steep, with problem set 1, and programming projects 2-4 being among the most stressful.  Cannon is not kidding when he says that the programming projects will require 10+ hours of work -- they really do!  Your best bet would be to start early on the projects and attend TA office hours whenever you hit a major rut.  \r\n\r\nLectures are helpful, but only as a brief summary of what you need to know.  To rely on lectures alone would leave you poorly prepared for the assignments in this class, but I think that for any technical class this goes without saying.  The two recommended textbooks are both very good resources and will be relied on heavily throughout the course.  I found that the lectures and problem sets were representative of exam content.  The programming projects, however, were not.  \r\n\r\nThe class is well organized, with a very clear outline of covered topics and assigned grading groups to expedite grading.  There is an entire army of TAs who rotate on a schedule to grade your problem sets/programming projects and who send you detailed grade reports VIA lionmail (more on the TAs later...).\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the course does a good job at its ambitious task of introducing students to the fundamentals of computer science and programming in Java.  In addition, you will also be introduced to software like: Pico, CUnix, CyberDuck, Eclipse, Vagrant VirtualBox (maybe), and Gimp.  Professor Cannon has a good sense of humor and tries to make even the duller aspects of computer science interesting.  If you commit yourself to doing all the work, the takeaway is enormous.  My only major complaint:\r\n\r\nTHE TAs (well, some of them):\r\n\r\nThe TAs are a mixed lot.  Some are truly wonderful and are willing to help you with all your NullPointerExceptions, while others seem plain butthurt about losing points for inane reasons back when they were COMS W1004 students.  Between the 6 problem sets and 5 programming projects, you'll come into contact with at least 11 of the TAs.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, your grade reports are sent to your lionmail by your TA of the week.  Frequently, students will respond to the grade report emails to ask for suggestions or for a more detailed explanation of how to improve code.  As I have heard from other students, and as I have experienced myself, this sometimes results in the TAs correcting your grade to a lower score.  What I mean is this: when the TA sees your grade report again in your reply email, they might see that they made a mistake in grading you and then will lower your score by the appropriate amount.  \r\n\r\nUntil the TAs start grading things without error, or until some sort of \"grade-is-set-after-sending-to-student\" policy is put into place, you should not ask the TA who graded you for pointers.  I repeat DO NOT ASK THE TA WHO GRADED YOUR ASSIGNMENT ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT--THEY MIGHT SPOT SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T TAKE OFF POINTS FOR AND THEN PROCEED TO TAKE OFF POINTS FOR IT.\r\n\r\nTo me this seems rather messed up.  Isn't the best person to learn from the professional who was paid to read through every line of your code?  As things currently are, it is impractical to talk to this person because they could easily spot a mistake in their grading and then make a last-minute change on CourseWorks.  In no other class I've ever taken in my academic career have assignment grades been so impermanent.  I overheard other students in the help room speak of \"avoiding\" the TA that graded their most recent assignment in fear that they could have points deducted.  I hate to think I could have done better in this class by NOT asking the person who graded my assignment for help...",

With this in mind, Intro to Java is probably one of the most challenging and time-consuming classes offered at Columbia. Unless you have to take this class for your major, be sure you REALLY want to take this class. There are much easier ways to learn coding and Java. When Cannon tells you at the beginning that this class will take at least 10 hours of work per week, he is telling the truth. Many times, the work requires a lot more than 10 hours/week. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of information that Cannon tries to teach in this course. You will learn both theory and programming in this class. Because of the amount of info he tries to teach, Cannon skips over a lot of basic stuff that he expects you to learn on your own. I had no experience in programming coming in so I wish he would not have skipped over stuff. For this reason, I would only recommend this class to someone who has some experience or background in coding. Talking to many who were in the same boat as me, we had to play catch-up throughout the semester. This class is already considered difficult to those with coding backgrounds, so it makes life even more miserable when you have to put even more work into an already difficult class.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for the class are usually pretty helpful. I would recommend getting help from the TA that grades your assignments since some of the grading, especially the written assignments, can be very subjective. I also went to Cannon's office hours. He does not come off as the nicest or most personable person ever, but he does try to help you out. He definitely does not try or care to get to know students (at least in this class). I will give him props for his cheesy jokes that lighten up the class.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you really have to decide if you are willing to do the work for the class. If you just want to take this class because you think coding will be \"fun\" to learn, do not take the class. Learn coding on your own at a pace where it can be fun, exciting, and addictive. Besides those who are majoring in CS, only those who are serious about learning Java and the theory of programming in a rigorous and often cutthroat setting should take this class.",

I usually feel bad when people don't laugh at his dumb jokes so I laugh pretty hard to give him some credit. I usually enjoyed going to lecture. I never brought my computer, though, because all his example code is posted on courseworks anyway. You can do your note-taking just as well in a traditional notebook, and if you know that you are easily distracted, I'd recommend not bringing a computer. The two lectures that I did bring one I may as well not even have showed up because I have no idea what happened.\r\n\r\nThe course itself is hard, for sure. This class is an introduction CS and programming class, so if you never took AP Computer Science in high school, you're going into a topic that you've literally never seen before, unlike most of your other classes. It's pretty satisfying, though, when a few weeks in you're already writing simple programs that can do tasks that you couldn't do a few weeks before.\r\n\r\nThe programming assignments are tough, especially compared to the homework which literally take maybe 1-2 hours tops. Programming takes probably 10ish hours. The singular most important advice is go to the TA office hours. There are like 8 TAs for the class. Obviously the TA hours the day before your assignment is due are going to be packed, so try to go earlier if you can. The ones in the middle of the week are literally empty so you could have one-on-one time to do your work with a TA sitting right there who sole purpose is to answer any questions you have and help with your programming.\r\n\r\nCannon also sets up an account for the class on this website, Piazza.com, that is basically a messaging board where people can ask questions and the TAs, other students and Cannon (occasionally) can answer questions. This is a really good resource because your question has almost always been asked by someone else, and you can ask questions anonymously.",

Let me just say that there aren't many classes I'd actually feel obligated to review, but this is definitely one of them.\r\n\r\nThis is so far the best class I've taken at Columbia. This class gives you a great overview of Computer Science, and an unmatched introduction to programming. Somehow Cannon manages to fit in a ton of material while still giving a good sense of each topic. The only exception to this would be the section of the class on computer networks, which I honestly feel could have been narrowed down to just the information about internet protocols. \r\n\r\nLearning object-oriented programming has a learning curve, but once you've got it, you're just coasting from then on. That's not to say projects don't take a while -- you'll spend hours trying to find bugs in your program. But in general, I think there's only a few concepts in this class that are difficult to learn, the main one being OOP. Nonetheless, Cannon and the TAs make themselves pretty available to you, and the assignments are not unreasonable. That being said, pay attention to what Cannon says: if he wants you to understand a concept by a certain homework (e.g. what objects are) you should do it, and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nI think the main idea I want to convey with this review is that the work you do, while heavy, is very meaningful, and you'll learn a lot about algorithmic problem solving and programming in Java.",

This is where I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.  Madhavan was a standout TA.  He stayed after his office hours by as much as three hours one time because people needed help.  When he was in the TA room attending office hours for his own CompSci classes, he would help 1004 kids who needed help.  No matter how many people came he would individually go through his students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 code to find problems big and small.  He also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t treat students who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know things like idiots which is more than can be said for some others of the TAs.  I would know, I went to pretty much every TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office hours.  Madhavan was not an easy grader, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because he knows his stuff and demands a high standard; if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be held to a high standard, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Columbia.

This is not an easy class, but it's very fulfilling. It's something I never could have seen myself doing, but I would absolutely recommend taking it. ",

Plus Cannon always goes on random CS-related tangents every once in a while and these are generally fun and informative.\r\n\r\nAs for the class, it's got two components; theory (Intro to CS) and programming (Intro to Java). Theory and programming homeworks alternate from week to week. Theory homeworks are not too bad, they can be done just from reading the relevant chapters in the book. Programming ones can be challenging and take varying amounts of time (depending on who you are) but you will certainly learn how to program at the end of it.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final aren't all that bad if you've been keeping up with the lectures and the homeworks. They're a bit on the memorization side of things - especially the final which asked some pretty obscure questions which is why it's good to attend lecture because he often mentions random things that I noticed ended up on the test.\r\n\r\nI should mention that although this is intro CS, it's a pretty high level intro so don't take the class for the granted - you'll have to put in some work to get an A.\r\n\r\nAlso there are lots of office hours and for the most part the TAs are great so I would highly recommend popping in if you have question regarding your assignment; even if you code works, you might wanna just make sure with the TAs that your design, etc. is okay.",

I would recommend this course to any strong student up for a challenge, even one who does not need COMS as a requirement.  Professor Cannon says it is not easy and tells us which assignments are especially hard, but CS will teach you a new way of thinking about the world.  Professor Cannon covers the basics of both hardware (the physical structure of the computer) and programming, so by the time you're done with the course you will probably know which topic you like better.  Lectures supplemented the readings and helped clarify which aspects of the materials were the most important.  One of Professor Cannon's strengths was making complicated concepts understandable.  He is willing to go over the same idea more than once, even at the expense of glossing over a few simpler programming concepts that I would have liked the lectures and assignments to cover a bit more thoroughly.  The final was DEFINITELY harder than the midterm, although neither was excessively difficult.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea for people without a very strong programming/hardware background to take W1004--you learn quite a bit about both and are a much more fluid programmer by the time you reach the more advanced courses.  Professor Cannon was very good at introducing us to the academic organizations and resources the CS department offers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are many TAs means that you should be able to come to a good TA's office hours (in my experience, decent to good TAing was the rule rather than the exception).

If you're not planning on majoring in comp sci, I advise taking this introductory course as opposed to CS1007. At the beginning of the course I thought Prof. Leslie was the worst teacher on the face of the earth, but then I realized that Comp Sci is just the worst subject on the face of the earth and that she is actually a pretty good teacher. She clearly presents ideas that are very complicated to understand. Her lessons are very structured and she makes the material as simple to understand as it can possibly be. Don't be alarmed if your a bit confused for the first 2 or 3 weeks, because if you've had no comp sci background (much like I had none when taking this course) it takes a little while to get used to the concepts. Prof. Leslie is an excellent teacher, although she is a bit nervous up there (i.e.: she laughs a lot when she talks and she writes EVERYTHING she says on the board!!!!! (in other words, if she says, \"It's sunny today\" you better believe it'll be up on the blackboard\")). She is also very approachable and extremely understanding. So besides needing to relax a little, she is a great teacher, and she made comp sci bareable for someone (aka: me) who HATES comp sci with a passion.",

I can't believe I wasted an entire semester's worth of time on such a disaster of a course, and it is beyond me how anyone could teach a course and call it \u201ceducation\u201d. \n\nGoing into this course, I thought that it would be an easy A. Past reviews of this course had said the same thing, except for one little detail: that Paine was NOT the professor. Paine\u2019s organizational skills and lectures are all over the place. One minute, you\u2019re learning about basic syntax, and the next you\u2019re asked to create an AI program to detect and predict future medical diagnostics. It\u2019s like Paine threw together random topics and created his syllabus by asking ChatGPT \u201cWhat should I teach in a Python course?\u201d. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s a complete disaster.\n\nAbout Paine himself: this person is the perfect example of boring and clueless. His teaching style is so dull and lifeless \u2014 it feels like he\u2019s trying to put the entire class to sleep. There\u2019s no passion, no engagement, nothing. It\u2019s like he actully couldn\u2019t care less about actually teaching the class. I find more excitement in cleaning my room than attending his lectures. No wonder less than 10 people in a 300 person lecture show up to class\u2026\n\nAt the beginning of the course, no grading details were posted on the syllabus. The same thing for the middle and at the end of the semester. Despite consistent questions if Paine could post a grading scheme on Ed Discussion, there\u2019s no response as Paine ghosts the entire class. And, as if things couldn\u2019t get any better, Paine releases the final grades ONLY THREE WEEKS after the grade submission due date. \n\nYou would think that the course wouldn\u2019t be graded so harshly. It\u2019s only an INTRODUCTORY class for FRESHMAN, so shouldn\u2019t the class at least be taught well? Wouldn\u2019t you expect Timothy Paine, a CS graduate from Columbia with SUMMA CUM LAUDE, to teach decently? And Paine says he can tutor CS for 300 DOLLARS PER HOUR on his website? You usually want someone with such accomplishments and connections to Columbia to teach a course you\u2019re taking \u2014 unfortunately, I think my dog could teach this course just as well as Paine. Rather than getting a Master\u2019s in Columbia\u2019s CS, a degree from the Teacher\u2019s College might be better suited for him. \n\nTo be honest, this is probably the worst learning experience I\u2019ve ever had. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this professor like COVID. ",

You will always run for help and it is draining. The lectures are long and boring that half of the students don't even show up.

He is approachable, kind, and fair, and he really does care for the well-being of his students. While his lectures can be dry at times, his notes concisely lay out everything you need to know. I thought the quizzes and the final exam had some minor tricks, but they\u2019re probably super easy if you have prior programming knowledge. The TAs are some of the best I\u2019ve had in any of my classes - they\u2019re patient and more than happy to steer you in the right direction without giving away too much. The head TA Spencer was always on top of hosting review sessions and preparing slides/Kahoots, which I found to be incredibly useful. As a whole, if you have to take 1006 (either because you\u2019re in SEAS or because you want a gentler start to CS before taking 1004), I strongly recommend taking it with Bauer. He\u2019s currently on parental leave this semester, but I hope to take more classes with him in the future!",

As someone who had never taken programming or computer science before, I walked in and I was immediately extremely confused. I went to the lectures, but I felt like they might as well be in French. \r\n\r\nHowever, Professor Ferguson realized that there was something wrong with this class. He asked for a lot of our feedback and drastically restructured how he taught later in the semester. Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect. But the fact of the matter is that he went through a world of effort to make the class better for his students. \r\n\r\nThere was also some confusion pertaining to assignments, but I think that will be refined over time. Also, his office hours were incredibly helpful. He would make extra office hours in the weekend to help students. Again, with zero programming experience, this was key for my success in this class. \r\n\r\nThe extra credit opportunities were also really helpful. \r\n\r\nSure, he has his sassy moments, but I think he has a lot of respect for his students and a high commitment to the class.

                "content": "Adam Cannon is not a good profesor for this class. He is undeniably good for the Intro to Java, but my experience in Python is negative. He knows his stuff, and while excuses have to be made since this is only the 3rd year this course exists, he is still refining the curiculum. However, while the cotent of the lectures was interesting (read: sometimes, other times not falling asleep was hard) they were only vaguely related to the homework, and most of the time, were it not for online documentation on Python, me and all my friends in the class would have failed. Although he leaves time in lecture for questions, his sometimes sarcastic answers and interactions with students discourage many from asking. Oftentimes, he will not actually answer the question posed in class, just tells you to \"deal with it\" in a roundabout way, or gives a non-sensical answer. His office hours dont help: although he holds the same amount of office hours as other professors, he is teaching about 400 students at a time, so there is always at least a 10-20 student line waiting to talk to him during office hours. To be fair though, there are about 5 TAs, though they often are not clear on the specific requirements of the assignment and will sometimes give you wrong information if you ask a mildly specific/complex question on the problem sets. Desperate emails sent the day before the homework is due dont get answered until after the dealine (though to be fair, he warned us that he would take minumum 1 or 2 days to respond due to the impressive amount of emails he gets). \r\n\r\nOverall, although Cannon is a good teacher, he is not good for this course. The learning curve is very slow for the first 3 weeks, and gets incredibly hard after that. While about half the students in the class have programmed before, for the half who have not, the problema set take significantly more hours tan the 8-12 Cannon gives as reference. So start early. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE OR YOU WILL NOT FINISH. \r\n\r\nAvoid this class unless you actually have to take it or you are pursuing a mayor/minor/concentration/ect in computer science or related fields. Takes up more time tan what is justified for a class that does not related or is not required for your degree (it is ridiculous how much time it takes away from studying for those clases which actually count towards your degree)!).",

If you fall into the latter group, like myself, I HIGHLY recommend reading up a bit on Python before you take the class because the learning curve is steep.  This review will come from the perspective of someone with no former programming experience:\r\n\r\nIntro to Comp Sci for Eng/App Sci is still in its 3rd year of infancy, so Adam Cannon is still developing the curriculum for this class.  Adam Cannon is a really nice guy who often makes the types of sardonic jokes that provoke a chuckle or two, verbally assumes that his class hates him, and gives riddles at the beginning of class to those students who already know the material and can afford to spend the duration of class pondering the riddle, life itself, or if they should attend the next class.  Lectures consisted of him going through topics rather rapidly (for someone who knows nothing of Python) and explaining examples of programs posted in CourseWorks.  For people with programming experience, the feeling of rushing may not have been the case, but some topics he introduced--especially for the homework--could be quite challenging.  We did not have a textbook, which I think would have been helpful, but I believe he is getting one next semester.  Often in class, Professor Cannon would ask if there were any questions and be greeted by silence and blank stares, to which he would respond, \"If 1 of you doesn't understand something, that means 10 more of you don't understand it either,\" sigh, and move on, so ASK QUESTIONS if you don't understand something.  Those afraid to ask questions will be extremely grateful that you did.\r\n\r\nHomework consists of bi-weekly projects that can be very tricky, so try not to procrastinate on these because Professor Cannon will answer questions about/go over the homework in class sometimes.  That being said, he will not baby you and give you the answer, only try to lead you on a path to finding the right answer, both in class and in office hours.  The TAs are all awesome and extremely nice (even if they are all really busy), and I highly recommend going to their office hours.  Both the midterm and final are written and doable, but you should study for them, no matter what programming background you have.  Overall, although this can be a challenging class, Adam Cannon is a satisfactory teacher, but it is up to you--the student--to ask him for help if you need it.",

Professor Borowski is not a great lecturer.\n\nHe is not excellent at explaining things in class, and he struggles to gain the attention of all the students because he mostly reads from the slides and does not give any explanations that may add to the content in any way.\n\nThe problem is that Dr. B and the TAs may not be very helpful.\n\nOnce in his office hours, Dr. B struggled with helping a student debug their code. Similarly, once a TA gave us a problem that he had originally said would take us 15 minutes to solve, and when he did that same problem during recitation, it took him 1 hour and 20 minutes to do the same. Also the class size is very large, so we had to wait hours for debug a single problem out of nine problems on each assignment.\n\nHowever, Dr. B didn't effectively convey the content. A good number of his assignments are focused on coding the basic implementations of the methods for Data Structures, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and hash maps. In my opinion, this is not a good thing because he did not give us enough practice using the method implementations to code more complex methods. This problem with the assignments is especially bad when you are practicing for coding interviews.",

Then, after the second Midterm, you had one week to complete a Capstone Project during the other final exams. That is a lot!\n \nHe often deducts marks for silly things, such as using additional space in the answers.\n \nDr. B gave 9 late days throughout the semester for 12 assignments in total. You cannot use late days on the Capstone Project and two of the theoretical assignments. Dr. B is not lenient with providing extensions. He provided class-wide extensions on two of the assignments, which led to work management issues as deadlines for them were pushed to be one or two days before the midterms.\n \nAdditionally, I have heard of a student who spent the whole week working on the Capstone project, and as a result, she did not have enough time to study for her final exams. She made a mistake in her submission, which was that she submitted an entire file instead of the specified code snippet, so Dr. B did not accept her work and gave her a 0.

I did not enjoy how he taught us how to code using DS algorithms by just perusing through the textbook code. It would have been nice if had done live coding of DS algorithms in example coding like he did in Intro to Java, because when it came to completing the homeworks, I understood the concepts but barely know how to code such concepts from scratch. His grading policy is very consistent, which I appreciate. The midterm was more difficult than what I expected. Even though he said what was going to be on the midterm, I found the questions to be more complex than I thought. There were a lot of tree questions, even though he had taught it the week prior without giving us time to absorb how trees work through homework.

Really disorganized\nPeople often say the best way to complete assignments on time is by 'starting early'. Well meet this class, where its almost impossible to start early because the coding assignments will be updated as late as one day before its due.\n\n3. 'Industry'\nThe prof will keep on saying that his unreasonable deadlines and his hackerranks 'teach you what its like in the industry' lol. If you know anything about current coding intrerviews at top companies, you'll understand how out of reach this approach is\n\n",

Connections between the data structures are not explained. A lot of times I had knowledge of the topic behind explained, but sat there and saw him explain it for the first time and thought that if this was my first time being exposed to what he is saying, I wouldn't have grasped the material. Honestly, a very frustrating experience. Also the book is terrible; the code is filled with a lot bugs. Skip class and learn the material on your own. Also use problems sets from other universities to actually learn data structures. If you are doing the problem sets being assigned and think they are easy, that is because you are not learning actual data structures, just a bunch of disconnected programs.

As a professor of a large lecture class, those two qualities are heightened: his jokes (though repetitive) can be stress-relieving, and if you have a background in java, his explanations are intriguing. However, if you don't have a background in java, Blaer is not very good at explaining simple concepts. He over-explains, confuses students, and gets distracted easily. I personally felt that my time was better spent on learning java online than learning in his class.\r\n\r\nOne specific moment that comes to mind is Blaer's introduction to stacks. He went on an hour-long description of the intricacies of a stack, over-explaining it, when in all honesty it's a somewhat-simple java topic. All he really needed to say was \"this is like a list, but instead of being able to access any node at any time, stacks follow the process of last-in first-out, like a tissue box or a pile of books.\"\r\n\r\nTo be fair to Blaer, he is an incredibly nice professor who has the difficult job of teaching nearly 450 students in one large lecture class. I'm not sure anyone would have been able to do as good a job as online learning, especially in a class on Computer Science. \r\n\r\nMy advice: take his class, but don't expect it to be great. Enjoy the comedic, positive side of Blaer, and deal with the negative sides of the class by learning online or reading the textbook.",

He is also incredibly nice & just a really genuine, down to earth person. \r\n\r\nAs for the class itself: I loved it as well & was definitely one of my favorite classes at Columbia so far. I had actually not done any programming in Java for a few years, because I had taken AP CS in high school & skipped 1004, so it took me a bit of time to adjust and remember/relearn some things. The class was definitely challenging, but not too much and in a good way I think. I really learned a lot from the class & fell in love with CS again (I wasn't a CS major going into the class, but I am now). \r\n\r\nThe TAs were also super super helpful & I highly recommend going to office hours to work on the assignments/study for tests (it's so much harder on your own trust me), and there are so many TAs so there are office hours like literally all the time which is so nice. \r\n\r\nThis class is required for the CS major & minor, but I'd honestly recommend taking it even if you aren't majoring/minoring in CS. I would also highly recommend taking it when Blaer is teaching,if possible (he's like 1000x better than the other profs who teach it).",

The homeworks he assigned were much harder than he realized and took several hours to complete- often dealing with little Java technicalities such as generics which were usually much more involved than Bauer taught in class. Additionally, the textbook for this class absolutely sucks but for the most part Bauer's slides were helpful. Overall, for a class that is so important for computer science majors, this class did not meet my expectations. I do think Bauer learned a lot from teaching this for the first time and this class will only improve.  ",

                "content": "Professor Blaer is a great instructor. He is clear, able to command a large lecture hall without much trouble, and able to explain concepts in a fairly simple manner. I honestly don't understand why some people chose not to attend this class because I found the book to be average at explaining concepts, while I found Professor Blaer to be exceptional at explaining the material. I rarely referred to the book after his lectures because I either understood the material from his lecture, or was able to understand is after digesting my notes. I think this is a sign of a great teacher. \r\n\r\nEven in a 200+ person class, Blaer was able to captivate the room with his large voice and abundant personality. In addition, he managed to encourage student participation, which kept the class interactive and engaging. In addition, occasionally, Professor Blaer would drive home the importance of a particular concept with a story about his research, which usually involved a hilarious and catastrophic ending involving multi-ton robots ramming into buildings or almost running people over. \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer's exams are fairly straightforward and he essentially tells you about 50% of the exam, so these are fairly low stress endeavors. I found the final harder than the midterm, but still fairly straightforward. Not much to worry about here. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint with Professor Blaer is an organizational complaint. He would usually claim he would post the HW by a certain date and note post it till 3 or 4 days afterwards. He also granted classwide extensions in unecesarry situations which made the last HW assigned and due during reading week, which was poor planning on his part. Lastly, I feel that the first 15 minutes of class, where students as clarification questions on the HW, is a waste of time. If he wrote his questions in a less ambiguous manner, and used this class time to teach more material, that would be more efficient. Apart from those organization things, I can't complain about this professor. I would recommend his class to anyone in a heartbeat. ",

Shit, after taking this class as a postbac, I was accepted to both Columbia and Penn for a Masters in CS, so I guess it worked out. His class will give you the A or A+ you need, presuming he grades you properly and submits appropriate grades. For me, that presumption turned out to be false. \r\n\r\nThe issue involved the professor giving me a B+ when I deserved and had been graded with an A. The reason for this problem was minor - I had been granted a written extension to turn in a final project, I turned the assignment in based on that timeline, and had received a zero by error of the professor. The professor agreed that I deserved an A for the class after grading my final assignment.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple communication attempts with him and spending over two months on the issue, the professor did not submit a grade change. He acknowledged the grade I had received was an A, but was either too busy/lazy to change it over basically the entire summer. This created deep stress for me, and concerned me, especially because I intended to apply for masters programs the next semester.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I brought my advisor in to help resolve the issue. After she confirmed the appropriate grade with the professor, she waited several weeks for the professor to resolve the issue. He didn't. She fixed the issue herself by submitting a document to change the grade.\r\n\r\nI believe this professor is an unfortunate member of the Columbia community, and is one of several reasons why I decided to attend Penn instead of Columbia for my masters program.

I've had a couple professors with silver nuggets who are great, but Professor Pasik is not one of them. \r\n\r\nPasik's class has a couple problems:\r\n\r\n1) his TAs. They are almost all jaded graduate/PhD students. In our case, 2 left throughout the semester, so as a result, all our assignments came back late. He did not hire new ones. They made TONS of grading errors, so make sure to go to office hours to check up on your quizzes. \r\nFinally, their rubrics are sometimes laughable. They award lots of points for the simplest things, and few for the most difficult parts.\r\n\r\n2) the structure of his class. He starts by covering a new topic with slideshow-supported lecture (slideshows posted on CourseWorks), consisting mostly of code and some text here and there. \r\n\r\nAfter each major topic (every 4 lectures or so), there's a quiz. Memorizing his code is a surefire way to get an A on these quizzes -- if you don't look at the code and didn't follow the lecture, expect to fail the quiz. Winging it is pretty tough. That being said, I failed two quizzes, but then scored significantly above the average for one I didn't study for at all. Why? No idea.\r\n\r\nAfter the quiz, you may or may not have a programming assignment. The programming assignment will probably be super easy.\r\n\r\n3) his code. Like people have said below, his code is extremely, extremely dense. He prides himself on brevity, but there is essentially a learning curve to reading his code (which shouldn't be the case, since you already know Java if you're taking this class). He teaches bad style that is not based on Java.\r\n\r\n4) him. Pasik is arrogant, but more importantly he doesn't hold regular office hours, so if you want to see him, either deal with his awful TAs or schedule an appointment.\r\n\r\n5) emphasizes weird things. We barely spent any time on hash tables and hash maps, but then spent tons of time on miscellaneous artificial intelligence topics at the end of the course, just because he enjoys them. You are learning the wrong material!\r\n\r\nTl;dr: please, please take a different section. This class is a crapshoot -- I never knew why I was getting the grades I did.

The class is as boring as you could make it, and the teacher is awful. You would think he might learn a thing or two after teaching for thirty years but the practice didn't do him any good. He prides himself on making his code as compact as possible, squeezing as much stuff in to one line as possible, which is stupid. It would be like cramming this whole paragraph in to one grammatically correct sentence. Sure, it's still \"right,\" but there's a reason no one does it, and that is because it is a fucking stupid thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took data structures at a different school a few years ago, and I thought I should take it again to brush up on the basics. It was a pretty big mistake; you would learn way more about data structures by skimming wikipedia for a week than taking this course. In fact, I would recommend learning the material elsewhere and then checking his slides to see the stupid shit he changes. \r\n If you're interested in CompSci, know that this is not what it's usually like.

I've heard and read so much about how he doesn't actually teach in AI, but for Data Structures that was certainly not true -- over the course of the semester we covered a lot of material even if it's less than you would in some other Data Structure sections. It is true that he only ends up coming to class about 2/3 of the time since there's 4 quizzes, 4 review sessions, and 1 final. When he's there though, he's very passionate and often quite amusing. I also found that between the lectures and the programming assignments I came out with a very thorough understanding of what he covered. Beware though that his programming style is extremely bizarre so you may pick up some weird habits.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes were kind of mini-midterms -- they took the whole class but only counted for 10% of your grade and only covered 3-4 lectures worth of material. Of the 10 points, 7 usually entailed coding and the others were either on theory or definitions.\r\n\r\nSince most of the class doesn't have a CS background (since the class isn't for the major) he spends a decent amount of time reviewing basics although if you really never understood Java at all, you'll be in trouble. One last plus about Pasik is that he's very organized: he puts up the class-by-class syllabus and all the homework assignments weeks before the semester even starts so the expectations for the class are unambiguous.",

                "content": "This class is a joke. Go to class, everyone says. And it is true, you should go to class if you really want to understand the material.\r\n\r\nWhat he does in class is he just goes over the coding that is on courseworks, first in general and then looking at the code itself. So for say, the linked lists, he would first explain what linked lists are, and then go over it in code. Of course, you really don't even need to take any notes, since if all you do is pay attention, you'll understand how the structures work and then you can just read the code to refine it even more.\r\nHe also let us out more than twenty minutes early multiple times, because that's how clear he makes the material.\r\n\r\nSo what makes this class a total joke? First, he assigns six homeworks. They aren't hard at all, and if you have a comp sci-major friend, they're actually easy. They don't take all that much time to do, and best thing, they're worth 50% of your final grade. 50% for six homeworks? Yup, he takes the \"lowest\" grade (you should be getting 10's on all the homeworks anyway) and adds it on as extra credit. If you have good enough friends, you should be getting ten points extra credit. Not only that, but on two of the assignments he had two MORE ways of getting extra credit: one was a simple, two line code, and the other was a bit tougher but still very doable, and he gave three points each for a grand total of sixteen points extra credit max. And note, these are on the HOMEWORKS, not on the tests that actually test your knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe tests make up the rest of your grade. Two midterms worth 15% each (15 points each) and a final worth 20% (20 points). They were also jokish. On each midterm he made sure to put at least one problem where you have to code, and one problem where it's a freebie 3 points if you went to class and listened (simple things like 'what is the time complexity of heapsort'). The final was a bit different: one tough problem, one very very easy problem (his freebie question worth 6 points, everyone should have gotten this one) and one coding (practically the same as the code in class). Even more, because all his midterms are point-based (they're out of 15 points), it's not like other classes where it's out of 100 and then scaled. What you get is how many points you add onto your final score, but with your sixteen points extra credit, you technically don't even have to take a midterm and you'll still get an A+. But even if you do, you're practically guaranteed an A+ unless you really don't know java, in which case you'll just get an A. He practically guarantees that everyone gets at least 7/15 points, so at most, if you aren't that good at java, you'll get 14/30 from the midterms. The final was much harder, but the TAs said that they graded generously, so you should probably get at least a 13/20 on the final, so that's 27/50, and then you add the free points from extra credit, and you get a 77/100, but then you add the extra credit and voila, you're back at a 93/100, and you get an A for doing so badly on the tests.\r\n\r\nDon't be scared when, in the first day of class he complains about grade inflation and describes how one standard deviation above the mean is a B and two standards is an A, because really, with that much extra credit (and the ease of this class), at least half the class got A-range grades.",

He's taught this course many times, so he knows what he's doing. There is a mad steep learning curve, starting with recursion. Once you get this, however, his code becomes a lot easier to understand. For each data structure, there is an abstract understanding of it, and there is a programming understanding. The conceptual understanding is more important; the programming is only important in the assignments (and he posts all his code on Courseworks anyway). His conceptual explanations makes use of diagrams, so recommend taking notes on pencil and paper. His explanation of each data structure is very systematic in this way.\r\n\r\nDoctor Pasik is very approachable, but only after class (he has no office hours). He always stays to answer all questions the students have; you can often get hints on the assignments this way. Additionally, he has lots of insight into the rest of computer science, and potentially a networking contact, depending on your desired industry.\r\n\r\nThe assignments can be difficult; however, you never have to work from the ground up (except the last one). You take his code from Courseworks, and using those basic methods, you build the rest of the methods to complete the assignment. Again, these additional methods require a conceptual understanding of what you are doing.\r\n\r\nHis grading style is interesting. There are 60 points worth of assignments (6 assignments, 10 points each), and 50 points worth of tests. To calculate the curve, he will take the 5 highest scores from everyone's assignments and the 50 points from the tests and calculate the average from that (curved to a B-).

I've always marveled at why I seem to enjoy classes taught by graduate students better than I do classes taught by actual professors, but I think it is because graduate students are more understanding of how to lead a class of undergrads in such a way that they will be interested and entertained.\n\nDavid Elson has two qualities that really qualify him as an excellent teacher, 1) excellent English and ability to explain concepts and 2) a wicked sense of humor.\n\nI have never missed a Data Structures class because of this; this was true of Chris Murphy's 1004 class I took last semester, too. David Elson really CARED that the students are learning the material -- he explains things clearly, does relevant examples, cracks corny jokes, and always tries to encourage class participation (a noble endeavor indeed!). His availability is also extremely flexible -- he answers emails even at excruciating times like 2 AM on a Friday or Saturday night, which really helps for the people who chronically try to complete hw assignments two days before the due date. The homework assignments started out rather tedious and long, but David took into account the class's complaints / suggestions and lessened the workload to really help us learn the implementations of data structures instead of spending 40 hours struggling with other irrelevant code. I love his programming assignments -- thought they were totally relevant and even FUN, dare I say. This is one of the few classes I ENJOY doing work for.\n\nAll in all, I thought Data Structures would be the death of me this semester, but I ended up loving it and learning far more than I thought I would. Thank you, David!!!",

The rubric is harsh, so precision matters.\n- As always, start the labs EARLY. Not because they take forever, but reinforcing concepts early pays off in this fast-paced class.\n\n----------\nExams:\nJae is an awesome exam writer, testing your understanding to the finest detail.\n- The problems aren't impossible\u2013everything comes directly from the lectures and labs. The real challenge lies in managing stress and focusing on meticulous details.\n- Some problems offer generous partial credit. Others? Miss one part and the others crash down like an avalanche ...\n- Practice helps, but luck plays a role too. At the end of the day, we are human, not computers, not gcc -g -Wall. We make mistakes, and that\u2019s part of what makes us human.\n\n----------\nGrading\n\nHis grading system is statistically fair for a class with 400 students: on AVERAGE, good students do well, and bad students struggle. However, each of us only takes 3 exams, not 400, so this \"fairness\" may break down entirely on an individual scale.\n\nThe takeaway is: Always try your best, but never over-stress about your AP grade. It's your learning and improvement that matter. Your grade is just a number; it correlates with, but doesn\u2019t always define, your abilities.\n\nAlso don\u2019t lose sleep over an A+.

The fearmongering about this course is INSANE and if you tell yourself the course is hard, it's only gonna make it harder for you. Yes, AP is a tough class, but if you put in genuine effort, you will be just fine! As with any course that is curved, you just have to do around average, so just make it your goal to score approx average on the HWs and exams. If you lower the bar, you'll be less stressed and score better.\n\nA lot of people say this course is useless. If you are a diehard SWE person, then you will also probably think it's useless. But, what many may not know is that a lot of roles want you to have a good understanding of basic networking, and that is exactly what AP teaches. \n\nHow to do well:\n-Show up to lectures. IN PERSON. Pay attention. So many people make the mistake of \"I'll just watch it later\".\n-If you don't understand something, ask for clarification IMMEDIATELY, either with classmates, TAs, or even Jae himself!\n-My most important tip: diagram/draft out the HWs ON PAPER before coding. HW6 (the second-hardest HW) took me only 2 hours to do because I wrote it all down on paper beforehand. If the paper version makes no sense, or if you don't even know how to start, go to the TAs and they will walk you through what to do.\n-To study for the exams, just do the practice exams over and over until you get nearly 100% on all of them. That's literally all I did to prepare. And yes, the exams don't always look like the practice, but if you do the practice exams, the actual exam will go way better for you.\n-Find a TA you like, and go to their OH every week. Make it a habit to go over content with them and ask them even the \"stupidest\" of questions.\n-DO NOT DROP LAB7. It will bomb your grade.\n\nI swear if you follow my advice above YOU WILL DO WELL. AP rewards attention to detail, hard work, and most importantly honesty. Like do not cheat. They will find you.\n\nMy grade breakdown:\nMidterm 1: slightly below average\nMidterm 2: exactly average\nFinal: 20% above average\nHW (with lowest dropped): considerably above average\n\nTL;DR: Just put in your best effort and ask questions.

Lab 6 and 7 take SIGNIFICANTLY longer. \n\nGrading is kind of harsh what can I say.\n\nThe exams are, as Jae claims, really tricky sometimes. It is like preparing for a standardized exam.

I strongly advise against this combo!\n\nJae is a funny, knowledgeable professor with a vivid passion for what he teaches. I would also argue that he is a very effective lecturer. \n\nThat being said, he seems disconnected from what students actually experience and learn in his class. Yes, this is a competitive school, and we expect top-notch education, but the brutal exams and harsh grading rubrics will almost certainly demotivate even the most determined student who truly wants to succeed in this class and stay passionate throughout the semester. Many students believe his exams simply require attention, but beyond that, you need to masterfully apply every tool you\u2019ve been exposed to, deeply analyze complex code under pressure, code on paper with precision, and navigate the provided materials for useful information.\n\nThe grading system adds to the challenge by offering little to no partial credit. Although the labs demand an extensive amount of time, they are entertaining and helpful for grasping the concepts on a surface level. However, they don\u2019t prepare you for the depth and rigor of the exams. While some lab content does appear in the exams, the labs are far less useful for exam preparation than Jae suggests. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m left unsatisfied with the course and feel I\u2019ve learned nothing particularly useful. It\u2019s disappointing, especially considering this is a 4-unit mandatory course requiring significantly above-average effort. I\u2019m expecting it to destroy my GPA.\n\nFriendly advice for those still determined to get an A: train yourself daily by following tutorials on YouTube or rewatching sections of his lectures. If you have the luxury of time, use it consistently and deliberately without overworking yourself\u2014 exams will appear significantly easier. But is it really worth it?",

C is a tough language, it's brutal and unforgiving, the exact opposite of python.  For me, the labs were not so bad because I had a good familiarity with C , git and Linux/UNIX fundamentals, but to those poor souls who had never seen C before, I can understand why this course is so challenging for them. Honestly, the first 2 or maaaaybe 3 labs were not so bad, but judging the difficultly from the perspective of someone who went in into the material \"cold\" with no C experience, I can understand why so many students leave negative reviews of this course. \n\nMy only major complaint about this course were the exams. They are deliberately made to be so incredibly challenging that you have to ask yourself why they are made to be so difficult. My educated, (conspiracy theory?), guess is that the exams are there simply to bring down the class average. That's literally it. That's all the exams exist for! Seriously, I'd roll my eyes as I read through the exam questions, almost laughing to myself at how ridiculous and \"try hard\" some of the questions were. Not all the questions were that bad, but some of them, c'mon, seriously?!\n\nIf you plan on working as a software engineer in the future and don't do well in this course, don't let your performance in this course make you feel bad. School is nothing like the industry, especially AP. This course does teach you a LOT of valuable things, but it's not at all representative of the industry. Learning C will make you a better programming, no doubt, and I can see why the professor designed the course as he did but if you didn't do well, don't let that get you down.

                "content": "TLDR: I hated pretty much everything about this class, it dried up any passion I had for learning CS, made me lose hope as a student at Columbia, and pushed me to seek therapy. I wish I could say that sentence was a joke or an exaggeration, but it was the literal truth. I switched to a different major after this course. This is not because this class is a weed-out (every one passes if you don\u2019t cheat). Rather, it\u2019s the soul-sucking, inhumane, pedagogical vileness and borderline insanity that occupies the mind of one Jae Woo Lee that pushed me away from this course and major, and he\u2019s a nice guy too so imagine that. \n\nMore comprehensive review: \n\nJae's philosophy is essentially: if you try, you'll learn a lot. \n\nWhat this does not mean: 1) you will do well on exams 2) you will do well on labs 3) content will click immediately. \n\nIn fact, it's quite the opposite. It is through the grueling intensity of this course's homework and the monumental challenges that are the exams that the fundamental material of this course will be cemented into your brain by the end of it (provided you don't cheat and pay attention). You will understand how a computer works (at the surface level at least); you will be able to work with a large pre-written codebase; you will be prepared for higher level systems and database courses. These are the central assertions that Jae makes in the first lecture and then rigorously proves over the course.  \n\nHowever, will you end up liking CS after this course? For many, I don't think so. Understanding and learning a lot does not equate to enjoyment. The massive influx of knowledge you get from this course comes at the cost of your passion for CS drying up. Jae will contest this. In fact, the paper he published (and continues to promote) about this course has (carefully selected) reviews of students who took his course and developed a newfound passion for CS that they did not get from data structures and 1004/1006/1002. One example includes a physics student who switched to CS after taking AP and then ended up getting a PhD in the subject from a top university. This entire paper is predicated on flawed reasoning (pretty typical for STEM professors attempting sociological research): that people study computer science because they like computer science. Most don't. Most saw TikToks about the 150k+ salary that software engineers make and decided to enroll in Intro-to-Java. Most see the degree as a means to an end (a job). A minority probably like systems as a subject (they'll end up taking OS or becoming TAs), but do not *DELUDE* yourself that this course is going to make you like CS if you view this degree as a path to an engineering job at some tech company. When this course is over, you will be relieved, so relieved as to the point that you might elicit a tear or two that it\u2019s finally over. You survived the war. The finish-line. You made it. Then, whether or not you have a brain, you\u2019ll either take more courses with Jae or move onto better professors. \n\nIs C + UNIX programming useful? No! Jae admits this in lecture 1. What you actually learn from this course is less about C and more about a) how a computer works and the internal memory processes behind it, b) the basics of OS, and c) how to practice iterative development. Teaching C and UNIX is simply a vessel to that end. \n\nSome niche advice: \n\nDon't fall into the cult of personality surrounding Jae. He's a nice guy, but he isn't divine when it comes to CS education. He will try to justify AP\u2019s structure and workload off of a paper he wrote in 2011; he will cite articles on his webpage about how Bwog considers AP one of the best classes at Columbia; he will crack a joke or two about his past life as a developer. \n\nDo not fall into this trap that you must take more courses with him. LEAVE. As that guy in Get Out said, GET OUT!\n\nHere are some immediate red flags that should tell you to leave: \n\n- In the first lecture, he led with \u201cyou\u2019ve probably read some bad reviews about me.\u201d \n- \u201cYou might not do well even if you try hard\u201d - a quote from his syllabus powerpoint. \n- He beefed with Hillary Clinton over some blackboards. Remember the last guy who publicly beefed with Hillary Clinton? Look what happened to him. \n- He continuously has to justify the difficulty of his course (mostly after every exam or an exceptionally hard homework) by citing papers he wrote, carefully selected student \n  reviews. \n- About 15 minutes before the second midterm, he emailed the entire class listserv a screenshot of text messages with his OWN SON who was taking AP as well. In these \n  messages, his son was lamenting about how hard one of the practice exams were. After this screenshot, Jae wrote a \u201cgood luck\u201d message and signed off on the email. Diving \n  into the thought process by this psychotic action, he probably wanted to convey \u201chey even my own son thinks my course is hard. Don\u2019t worry about that much.\u201d What it ended \n  up coming off as was \u201chah lol my son is struggling with exams I WROTE lemme expose him to a group of 650 classmates.\u201d\n\nThis course is a hurdle that every CS major has to get through. Climb, fumble, collapse, or jump effortlessly over this hurdle and do not look back! On the bright side, I know entire friend groups that formed during AP over the sheer collective trauma. You will leave this course with some new comrades to swap war stories with over a couple of cigars. You\u2019ll never see CS majors be more social than when the AP Lab is due. \n\nTo finish off this review, I'll leave a quote from his first lecture powerpoint: \"Please don\u2019t get stressed out about AP.\" \n\nI did.

If you fall behind by more than 2 weeks, consider P/Fing the course or dropping it entirely. It is extremely difficult to catch up. \n\nDon't take this course with other hard courses.

Lecture notes are uploaded to the webpage, so don\u2019t feel compelled to take copious notes. Focus on understanding. This starts at lecture 1 and does not end until the lecture before the final. \n\nI barely went to OH though. The TAs in this course definitely know what they're talking about content-wise but they're actual advice for doing well in this course is subpar at best. For example, a TA emailed us a practice exam problem, citing that we should be able to complete it in under 50 minutes. During the practice problem review session, it took the TA 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete the problem. Moreover, there was repetitive emphasis on \"drawing it out\" which I found to be garbage advice. For one, you only get 75 minutes for two-three fairly difficult questions. Spending time to draw everything out is wasting precious time to actually get to the right answer. "

You are not expected to know C or UNIX prior to the course, but if you want to do well, I'd highly recommend reviewing the aforementioned books, although Jae's lectures generally do a good job of explaining the material.\n\nThe programming labs in this class are excellent, they follow a steady progression, as each lab builds off the last. If you pay attention in class, read the book, meet with the TAs to clarify concepts you're confused on, than generally, you'll be fine. Yes, the more you progress through the course, the harder and more time consuming the labs become. A few tips for doing well: always test your code before submitting it, and START EARLY! The TA office hours are packed to the brim a few days before the lab submission is due.\n\nThe problem with this course are the exams. They are far, far too difficult and challenging, even by Columbia standards. Regardless, if you make a good effort to study the practice exams and know the content, you'll probably do well.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend taking this course at the end of your time at Columbia, if you're worried about your GPA.",

He can be a bit \"funny\" in class and on EdStem, is very easy to talk to in office hours, and works very hard (on more than one occasion he typed out very detailed responses to questions he got in class). However, I didn't come out of the class - both classes - feeling like I *learned* anything at all. I definitely memorized a lot of things - all of which I have completely forgotten now that the course is over - but I never got to see why things work the way they do, and never really came close to achieving a big-picture view of the class. I think the \"weekly quizzes\" section of the class grade was pointless given that its intention was to encourage attendance. I know I'm going to sound arrogant here, but I really think the homework assignments were too easy. At best they helped me improve my pattern-matching skills, because very similar work was already done during class. Add in the fact that we worked on them with a partner, and I didn't spend more than 5 hours on any of the 7 homeworks. The exams are a horrifying joke; to study for them, I recommend you find a way to somehow download the Linux man pages of every single function you ever used in class, homework assignments, or recitations into a memory cache in your brain (this is an exaggeration), but this is a feature of any AP class you take anyways.\n\nAll in all, I definitely don't feel ready to take OS with Nieh at all, despite getting an A in this class.

Despite its difficulty, I\u2019m pleased to say that AP with Jae has only reaffirmed my passion for CS.\nJae is fantastic. He cut out the C++ content and labs 8-10, which made the course far more manageable. His lectures were clear and I never felt lost. And even though he puts on a serious face in class, he\u2019s actually really cool and hilarious if you get to know him at the Hackathon. All the TAs in Spring 2021 were extremely patient and helpful, which was assuring given that the TAs in earlier CS classes were often hit or miss.\nThe course is still a rigorous step up from the toy programming in Data Structures. After all, pointers, memory allocation, and network programming are naturally tougher topics. However, AP isn\u2019t the weeder that it was (and probably still is) known for. It\u2019s true that the labs are longer, but Jae also gives plenty of hints during class, so you should always have some kind of entry point for each project. In addition, the specs are so detailed that you can guarantee yourself a perfect score every time.\nI took the class when the exams were still online. They\u2019re still the hardest part of the class, but I noticed that they were more similar to the labs than a lot of the sample paper exams were. This is probably why Jae always said you\u2019d get the most out of the labs if you did them all by yourself, and I would agree with his assessment. Yes, it sucks to stay up until 3am figuring out where your program is going wrong. But once you debug the error, your brain will be tuned to avoid repeating the same mistake in the future. You just can\u2019t achieve the same effect if you rely on the TAs to fix everything for you. If you don\u2019t go through that process yourself, you\u2019re going to struggle on the exams.\nAs for grading, I thought Jae had one of the most forgiving curves ever. For a \"weeder\" course, it\u2019s difficult to fail; the C- cutoff this semester was 12.456. It seems that the only way you\u2019ll fail is if you cheat or barely put in any effort.\nTL;DR: It\u2019s a great class and there\u2019s nothing to be scared of. Don\u2019t cheat, start the labs early, and you\u2019ll likely be fine.",

But this course is notoriously brutal. \nThis class is designed as a conjunction from the C programming language to advanced things such as operating systems and computer networks. So if you ask what I learned from this class, I'd probably say, nothing? Mmmmm, not really, a little bit of everything: OS, TCP/IP, database, etc. \nJae did really good in lecturing, and it's quite amazing how he just linked all this \"everything\" together. I don't need to explain this point since this is basically a consensus from everyone. You will like his lecture and learn a lot here! \nBut, the bad thing about this course is grading. Nobody wants to spend more than 25 hours a week on this class and only got a B, right? What you learned matters, for sure, but how much your input and what the GPA is also matters. I just can't understand why Jae does not really see this point. I almost spent half of my study time studying this course, but what I am expecting is a B/B-. I just keep on saying that it doesn't matter, at least I did learn something. But the reality is that the grade was, is, and will be harsh. \nJae said, yes, somebody learned this in advance, and they will surely do better and get better grades, though he doesn't encourage people to do so. So the unfair part of this course is, it doesn't award hard work, it awards knowledge. If you learned this, never go to the lecture, did everything perfectly, and you will get good grades. If you learn this the first time, you are not likely to end in A range anyway. \nI am just a normal guy, who never learned CS in high school and expected to study hard and do well in college. I just don't understand where all those crazy guys come from! They seem to know everything already! I want to get good grades as much as those guys! If every class in Columbia is designed like this, I guess I will never find a job with my GPA. Grade fxxking matters! Why can't he just curve the grade slightly better! \nI literally feel sick about how harsh the grade curve is, and it DOES NOT FAIRLY represent my efforts in this class! But lucky as I am, Covid 19 allows me to PDF it. \nWith regard to whether or not you should take this class, I mean, CS guys don't really have a choice? Right? So good luck with it!",

That being said, I managed to get an A- in this course and my goal is to hopefully not come across like I'm bragging but just to make everyone who's currently doubting their abilities heading into this course feel a little more confident in their potential to succeed.\r\n\r\nObviously all the reviews agree that it's hard, but it's up to you whether you want to treat it as a 'lifestyle' or not. I usually started the homework a couple of days before the due date (except for HW7) and got around the median each time. I think the two things that really helped me were the videos they uploaded on YouTube and rewatching the lectures but at twice the speed. Counterintuitively, as someone who really has trouble focusing in class, this forced me to pay attention since it gets rid of the little pauses where I would accidentally zone out. \r\n\r\nMaybe you'll like the listserv format or maybe you won't but either way, you're probably going to be stuck with it so use it to your advantage. It makes me nervous to ask questions anonymously, let alone in an email to everyone in the class, but it was helpful to go through each of them prior to the midterms and final and seeing whether I could answer in my head similar to how the TAs would answer each question.\r\n\r\nI would say you don't have to start reviewing super early for the exams (although like in all classes, the more time you leave to review the better your chances), you're the person who knows you the best so just leave yourself enough time to be able to go through the sample exams and ask questions to the TAs in person if you have any.\r\n\r\nI hated hearing the TAs say this, but the exams really are just basically like puzzles and it's a combination of luck over whether it covers your strengths and how much time you dedicated studying and absorbing the homework in general. Regardless of the amount of importance it might promote on itself, AP is still just a class in the end. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a couple of super freshmen in the course, but most of us have been here for at least a year now when taking it so just try your best to learn from your mistakes or successes in your previous courses and you should be ok.\r\n\r\nAnother very important thing to note, Jae won't fail anyone unless you cheat so if you start thinking about cheating because you're afraid of failing the course then know you would be so much better off just taking the L instead of receiving the cheating email at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

Anyone who's had an internship or real world experience knows that coding just takes time to learn, and it can be very painful in the beginning.  Jae isn't hateful; he's just realistic.  He's been on the other side, and he knows that your boss isn't going to hold your hand on the job and make sure everything's okay.  They're going to expect you to be a self-starter and learn things on your own.  Welcome to the real world, kiddos.  If you don't just \"get it\" because you're A) bad at logic B) you had good training coming in here or C) you're not extremely stubborn, maybe you just aren't cut out to be a professional programmer.  This is what adulthood is like.\r\n\r\nOne time a friend came up to me and said \"Jae's tests are hard.\"  Have you guys actually tried to build anything in the real world?  Engineering is just like that; shit breaks and you have to fix it.  You can't care about your feelings; you just have to make it work.\r\n\r\nAlright, I've done enough tearing into you guys.  Take this class seriously, and you'll learn a lot.  Most importantly, you'll learn how to hold yourself accountable and have high standards.  You'll get eaten alive in the competitive world of software without that kind of attitude.  Jae Woo Lee is one of the most practical professors I've had at Columbia, and I'm glad I got knocked off my high horse by him and learned some perspective.  If you take OS, you'll truly begin to understand how deep and impressive a good programmer can be.  Consider yourself initiated once you've been through all this.  And if it's not for you, that's okay.  Don't blame Jae.\r\n\r\nI'm a much better programmer thanks to this class.",

Do the readings as they're assigned, at least the required ones; if you don't, you will most likely fall behind.\r\n\r\nJae's lectures go by quickly, so make sure you take notes quickly or have recordings for backup (usually if you ask the listserv for recordings, someone will have one). You want to use a combination of hand-written and typed notes because he talks fast and writes a lot of code and diagrams on the board.\r\n\r\nThe labs are not terribly difficult but they can take time if you want to make sure your program(s) work exactly as instructed.\r\n\r\nThe exams ... oh boy ... The averages are typically in the 40s-50s, with even lower medians, but the curve is generous (but not that generous). In Jae's words, \"if the average is a 40, then a 50 is good\" (but of course it's not). Aim for a 60-70 exam average for an A- and 75+ exam average if you want an A (assuming your labs are perfect or near perfect). The exams account for 75% of your grade, so they're a huge part of your grade.\r\n\r\nThe TAs can be a mixed bunch, so choose your favorite(s) and they will help you succeed on the labs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do well in AP, I suggest you\r\n- allocate 15-20 hours a week for it; if you feel like there's nothing left to be done for the week, you're wrong.\r\n- take a good set of lecture notes (Jae's notes are just a skeleton); review them regularly\r\n- do and REDO every one of Jae's practice exams - this is critical!  You should ask a friend to grade them (if you have friends).\r\n- go to office hours regularly - you are bound to have questions while studying. Each week, I collected a list of questions to ask the TAs or Jae.\r\n- talk to the TAs about the labs. they will give you hints. More often than not they will indirectly tell you exactly what you need to do or how to approach a problem. Ten minutes during office hours can save you hours in the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It's nice to have a professor who cares so much about the class and the students. He hosts a hackathon with food and the only chance of the semester to work with friends on a homework. Jae is a great lecturer. GO TO LECTURE and ask questions!\r\n\r\nThe homeworks are called labs, #1-10, and are worth 100, 120, or 150 points each. Pay careful attention to the homework instructions, they are very specific and graded exactly to homework specifications. Best advice is to go to lecture, go to the review sessions, and start the homework early so you can go to office hours before they get super crowded near the homework deadline. If you do this you should be able to get good grades on all the labs. \r\n\r\nJae is a stickler for academic honesty/no cheating, and it was both the most stressful (when asking friends for help and not wanting to cross the line) and the best part of the course. Since you have to do essentially every part of every lab by myself (besides TA help) my confidence in myself as a programmer grew a ton with every lab.\r\n\r\nThe exams are ~very~ hard, yet doable. If you stay on top of the material, start reviewing early, and understand what you are programming you can do well. The questions require clear knowledge of C fundamentals, and exams often include at least one question that is incredibly complicated. Exam questions are pretty similar to the types of questions on the sample midterms/finals.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of hype about how horrible and difficult AP was before I took the class. Don't let that scare you, it is totally possible to do well and have fun in this class!\r\n",

Frankly, most of us found it ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe midterm exams are insane. The median is usually around the 40's-50's.

Supposedly, he runs all written code through a program that compares your code to EVERY SINGLE SUBMISSION FROM THE PAST 5 YEARS. There are 3-400 people in the class per semester.

I read the text, watched videos on Lynda, and went to TA OH and found the labs totally doable but EXTREMELY time consuming. With Lab 7 probably taking me 20 hours to complete. The short answer/long answer midterm exams were (I assume) intentionally impossible with class medians hovering around 45. The final was fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, true/false so was much much easier. Jae will send you practice exams. Do all of them. One of the hardest things about his exams is the way he words his questions and attempts to trick you, so practice exams help. \r\n\r\nAs an instructor...I found Jae to be too disorganized to learn from and preferred to study with my own materials. Pedagogically he was, honestly, a nightmare, a nightmare barely concealed sadist. and sometimes would send emails that told students they must \"suffer\". He also uses language like \"punish\" when speaking of how he likes to \"punish students who don't do ____\". Before he announces his miserably low medians, sometimes he will laugh for an extended period. etc. I found his teaching style completely creepy.

I wouldn't even want him as a TA for this class. \r\n\r\nHis two main objectives are: Make blisteringly difficult homeworks and tests, and catch cheaters. \r\n\r\nYou will hear him talk about cheating in almost every lecture. It's his favorite subject. He sent out several unprofessional emails to the class ranting and raving about cheating, including one where he called cheaters \"douchebags\". At the end of the semester, maybe three weeks before the final, he sent out a threatening email to those he suspected of cheating saying they had until the next morning to reply as to whether or not they cheated and the first word of their email had to be yes or no. If they said no there would be a formal investigation and the consequences would be much worse than if they just admitted cheating. He sent this email on a Friday night, where no one would be at the school to advocate for, or give advice to the students who received the email. I had some friends get the email, who didn't think they had cheated, but because of the threatening nature of the email, they didn't know what to do. Some of the cheating accusations came from homework assigned toward the beginning of the semester. So he waited until just before the final, when stress was highest, and sent a threatening email forcing students to incriminate themselves, or else. \r\n\r\nOne student gave him a doctor's note because they were sick during a test. He didn't believe them, and passed their note around to the TAs. There is no reason for him to share someone's medical information with TAs. \r\n\r\nThe tests were ridiculous. He gives you tests from past semesters to study from, but all they will do is show you that your test will be just as impossible as those were. The averages were low, something under 50 for the midterms, I believe. This is the only class I've ever had where I felt like I wasted time by studying. I don't care if I get a B+, if you give me a test where I get 40/100, I'm going to feel stressed and deflated. \r\n\r\nThe homework was insanely difficult and time consuming. If you have a ton of experience programming, far beyond Intro to Java and Data Structures, it might not be so difficult, but it will be time consuming. Think 20-30 hours per assignment toward the end. \r\n\r\nThis listserv for this class is annoying. You get dozens and dozens of emails a day. It's not well organized. \r\n\r\nThis has the opportunity to be a great class. Knowing C and C++ is very valuable. This class should not be taught by Jae Lee. No class that is required for a major should be taught by this man. People should be able to choose whether or not they want to subject themselves to his teaching. It blows my mind that he has good reviews on here. I feel like I'm looking at a conservative's Facebook page filled with pro Trump propaganda. The only reason I can think for this is that you've never felt relief like being done with this class. If you struggled through like most of us, you'll probably never want to think about AP again, let alone write something about it. ",

He is boring and uses abstract class notes, while not following any reading order, just to confuse you even more.\r\n\r\nHe uses an old school teaching method where telling a student he sucks should motivate him or her to do better and try harder.\r\nThe grading system is unfair and discouraging. The exams are ridiculously hard and don't reflect in any way how much of a good programmer you are. The problems on the exam are tricky and concentrate on memorizing syntax and Linux command line outputs, also if you understand tricky instructions.\r\n\r\nJae exploits the fact CS students are obligated to take AP to demoralize students. With so many good CS professors that Columbia has to offer, it is a shame one has no choice but to take AP with Prof. Lee.",

                "content": "Jae is an excellent lecturer who is very clear about his explanations. Even though his lecture notes are already quite good, it's definitely worth it to come to lectures, since Jae provides useful supplementary information and also runs sample code so one can see how the code exactly works. \r\n\r\nThe TAs are also very willing to help you with the code (as long as you put in the effort, of course). The recitations are more or less just review of the lectures, but if you want more practice or sample code, it's good to check them out.\r\n\r\nThe exams are quite tricky. The best way to prepare is to definitely read all of the lecture notes very carefully (VERY CAREFULLY), understand exactly what each line of code does, understand how each lab works, and read K&R or the C++ book carefully. It might even be helpful to write and run your own code to ensure you know what is happening. Furthermore, Jae might reuse exam questions from the previous midterms, so definitely learn from your mistakes. \r\n\r\nThe labs vary in difficulty. As long as you have the proper prerequisites (Data Structures, some familiarity working with UNIX commands and hopefully Vim/Emacs, and good coding habits) and as long as you follow along in class, the labs will be straightforward. Pointers are actually not that difficult if you follow along and draw pictures. The hardest lab is lab 7 in which you have to write a web server. It's not difficult conceptually, but it's difficult because there are many parts you have to keep track of. Make sure you debug your code constantly (instead of writing the whole lab in one shot) and get started early! Be sure you do well on the labs, since the averages for labs, unlike those for exams, are usually very high. \r\n\r\nPersonally I thought the listserv was a giant clusterfuck. However, if you care enough to look through all of the emails (questions about the labs, questions that have already been asked, emails from TAs exasperated at people who repeat the same questions), you can gain some useful tips for finishing labs or figuring out exam questions. Just make sure you search for your question before you create a new email, and don't reply-all to announcement emails. It's essential that you set up an inbox filter to filter all of these emails.",

He's actually nice if you get his attention.  It seems like he prefers a student that doesn't need their hand held (which is the intimidating part) but pestering him is a good way to show him you care/will work hard.  I think that could be why some students don't like him as a person.  If it's really that bad, then hire a tutor (I did).  Your tutor is pretty much your employee at that point.  If you can't hire a tutor (a good CS tutor is $$$$$), then you need to make sure this is the only difficult class you are taking because you will live in the TA room.  If you can't either see Jae, hire a tutor, or be in the TA room for almost every OH, then you are probably cheating in order to do well.\r\n\r\nMy advice for the cheaters is that you will get caught so proceed with caution.  You could lie (most cheaters are also liars), but you'll get caught!  I can't stress this enough.  Jae says this in the beginning too and people still think they can do it. \r\n\r\nMy advice for if you don't cheat (i didn't but I almost regretted not doing it), just let it go.  I think Jae pretty much hit the nail on the head when he said those people who cheat like that won't make it very far in the world of CS.  Just worry about yourself and try your best to have fun.  There was an intrinsic reward in the end.  I did become a better programmer after this and real world programming made just a little more sense.  \r\n\r\nGo to every lecture and don't bother opening your laptop.  The notes are posted to the server so stop pretending you're taking notes and just watch what he does.  Read over the notes later.\r\n\r\nUse the drops and extensions strategically.  You will need them, but try not to drop any of the ones right around the midterm.  I think around lab5-8/9 (can't fully remember) is when you really should focus.\r\n\r\nThe exams are tricky.  If you don't like your grade just argue a lot.  I will say that if you KNOW how to do the homework, then you KNOW what he's asking in the exam.  You'll be able to argue for your points (all points matter) if you KNOW.  Also, his exams are pretty much from the lectures and old exams. ",

However if you get through it you will have learned as much in this course as self-taught programmers may learn in years, if ever. I write this from a perspective of someone who took this course with basically zero knowledge of computer science or programming experience coming into this class. \r\n\r\nWhat the class covers really well: C.\r\n\r\nWhat the class will force you to learn by sheer force: the UNIX environment, working with a shell, basic git commands, how memory works under the hood, and more C than you ever care to know, and then some.\r\n\r\nWhat is briefly touched upon: multi-threaded programming through blocking functions, sockets/networks, and basic under the hood stuff for C++.\r\n\r\nJae begins the semester with the claim that he'll turn students of programming into actual programmers which sounds like an ambitious task but he pulls it off fairly well. By the end of the class, you will have coded a linked list in C, written your own web server, and some minimal C++ experience, all of which isn't that impressive on paper. However, the skills you learn here will be applicable to nearly any job you hold as a computer programmer unless it's really implementation-heavy front end stuff. Even then, you will come away with experience of having to read lots of documentation with very little guidance on how to use it, which is expected of all programmers. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do programming as a career and are debating taking this class because of the grading, take it anyway. You'll learn a lot more than you think regardless of your grade. He grades to a A- and in my semester he curved everyone to at least a C-. I did terribly on my first exam and still eked out a B+.\r\n\r\nThis is sort of a requirement: get to know your TAs really well. They are all super helpful, smart, and were probably the reason I didn't drop out after failing my first midterm. They really make or break your experience in the class. ",

It's truly inspirational how Jae teaches (Sidenote:  Chris Mulligan and Jonathan Balsano, the head TA's are also a plus for this course; they know everything and they will go the extra mile to make sure you know the way Jae wants you to know the material). The labs get progressively harder (lab 2 is particularly challenging for those that only know Java and thinks they know everything).\r\n\r\nJae hands out a bunch of very clear yet brief set notes for every topics. The listserv is very useful and you won't have to wait more than a couple of hours before a TA responds to your questions.\r\n\r\nThe bad part are the exams. For all the thought Jae puts into the labs and lectures, I feel he hasn't figured out a way of writing exams that aren't so unforgiving yet as challenging as the ones he cooks up. No matter how many hours you spend studying for the exams, you will be challenged. There are no easy questions. You almost certainly will need to go through an overly-complicated program that makes you follow 10-15 logical statements that intersect and go through overly-complicated loops. Almost always the questions will be either right or wrong, and there aren't many questions (usually 10 in midterms, 20 in final). Normally this wouldn't be such a problem, but each question usually tests for 3, 4 or 5 things at the same time. So even if you knew everything there is to know about 4 concepts, if you missed the one, you won't get the answer right (guessing here is really, REALLY bad) and you will probably end up losing a bunch of points. His exams are all or nothing, meaning that you won't get partial credit over anything. You truly are as strong as your weakest topic.\r\n\r\nThen again, if you want to be a programmer or you want to do something related to programming later on, take this course. You will learn more in 3 months than you could expect in a year. If you are not a programmer, nevertheless take this course.

I started as a sophomore, shortly after 1004, with the mindset of \"let me just make this program work.\" That mindset led me to a 50% by the time the withdrawal date came around (which would've been a B-, but I thought I was failing) so I withdrew.\r\n\r\nI enrolled in the class again 2 years later, this time with the programmatic maturity to understand what the class was really about, and why that information mattered. Although the classwork takes the format of programming assignments, they are really about the underpinnings about C/languages (e.g. memory management, pointers, etc.). If you want to learn it well, you should break things! Rewrite your labs in different notations (e.g. array vs. pointer) to learn the differences. Become intimate with C. \r\n\r\nThe reason I mention my backstory is to help advise students who are on the fence about taking the class now or later. Some people can handle AP early on. But two years ago I honestly didn't care about freeing memory or understanding where my variables were stored. I gradually developed that interest after taking a few more CS courses/ being asked such things in interviews, and I am very happy I had the opportunity to take AP again. I got a lot more out of it, and the class was immensely more interesting.  \r\n\r\nThe class has 10 labs, of which 1 (lab 8) is optional. In the past, Jae had a policy of only granting class-wide extensions and every lab would be extended. He has changed his policy, for the better, to allot everyone 7 penalty-free late days each, to be used whenever (with a max of 2 late days for a given lab). This is a great policy, since it allows you to manage your time a lot better.\r\n\r\nThe class also has 2 midterms and a final. The all-or-nothing nature of many of the questions means the grades are relatively polarized--you could do extremely well or extremely poorly, for missing 1 simple thing. If you get above a 90, you really know what's up.\r\n\r\nSo I mostly wrote this review to call out the author of the last post (December 2013) regarding handling of the final. To give readers some context, several people in the class missed 5 points of a 20-point question for different reasons and proceeded to somewhat aggressively mail the list-serve arguing over which wrong answer was \"less wrong\" and deserved 2 extra points. Several TAs and Jae explained the reasoning to the rubric in response. \r\n\r\nTo insult Professor Lee's English, when he so eloquently and rationally addressed each concern from the email chain in a class announcement, is incredibly rude and borderline racist. Full disclosure: I missed 10 points of the same problem for a different reason, and though I disagreed with the severity, I had the decency to not make personal attacks.\r\n\r\nThough I found grading in the class sometimes tough, and I did not do as well I as would've liked, I learned *a lot* and became a much better programmer. Much of this is due to Jae. He is one of the few people in the department devoted exclusively to his students. I have personally experienced how he uses student feedback to iterate on his teaching from semester to semester, in order to better serve his students. He organized a class hackathon this semester, complete with pizza, Insomnia cookies, and t-shirts, to help students connect on an informal level. He stayed there the whole time, until 5:30 am, making sure he chatted with everyone at least once before he ran off to take his son to soccer. He learned my name despite the large class size (I never attended office hours or anything either).  He is one of the best professors I have had in the department, and I would recommend taking his class to anyone mature enough (as a programmer/student/person) to handle it.",

                "content": "I agree in general with the May 22 2013 reviewer on some of the basics (don't go anywhere near anything taught by Shlomo Hershkop, the exams are a bit of a crapshoot, details on labs can be a bit overwhelming but the detailed specs are ultimately a net positive) so go read that and then I'll focus on a few points where we differ to some degree/where things have changed:\r\n\r\n- This not \"just a programming class.\" Getting familiar with C means getting familiar with a lot of low-level system functionality. If you don't understand pointers and memory management completely intuitively, you'll never really understand what's going on in higher-level languages like Java. Jae Lee definitely gets you acquainted with pointers and memory management.\r\n\r\n- But you will learn a lot about real-world programming. For example: I hated the listserv early on and sent the professor a frustrated email about it, but I came around eventually. A lot of the big (and small) open source projects are built around listservs and all that comes with them. This class's listserv gets you used to the number and type of emails (including repetitiveness), the personalities that appear (the noob who asks a question he could've googled, the guy who replies to everything within 10 seconds but is kind of an asshole, the Benevolent Dictator For Life, i.e. Jae Lee, etc.), and so on.\r\n\r\n- YAXing (as many extensions as you want) is gone as of this semester. By all accounts, that's a big improvement. Also, we had two midterms this time around instead of just one.\r\n\r\n- I felt that the exams assessed the material quite fairly, although they generally played to my strengths and I did well on them without studying, so people who studied a lot and still did poorly likely feel otherwise with good reason.\r\n\r\n- Focus on the principles, not the details. C, C++, Unix and TCP/IP all have a really deep underlying logic and if you can wrap your head around it you're set. Everything is there for a reason. If you remember the reason you can derive the details on the exam. For example, in Unix and C \"everything is a file\" (external devices, actual files, other programs, etc.) so when you write to stdout you're writing \"to a file.\" When you read from stdin, you're reading \"from a file.\" Sockets can be treated exactly like a file. BUT because \"everything is a file,\" a \"pointer to a file\" (FILE *) can't possibly be an ordinary derefencable pointer -- dereferencing, after all, is the act of visiting a location in memory and reading some information out, which you can't conceivably do with a web socket -- so if you worked through that logic, you wouldn't make the mistake some people did of thinking that a file pointer can be dereferenced. So, principles, not details.\r\n\r\nIn general, I liked this class a lot, though a grading dispute on the final exam made me seriously question Professor Lee's judgment/command of the English language. However, given that I did not witness any other such problems, I'll be charitable and assume it was a truly isolated incident.",

                "content": "I definitely wasn't alone in that I had a lot of mixed feelings about this class.  I'll start by saying that is certainly the only viable option for taking Advanced Programming.  (Sidenote: If you're even thinking about taking Shlomo Hershkop's course, you're better off dropping out of school than wasting your tuition on an insulting elaborate practical joke).  However, I wouldn't call this class an amazing one that you absolutely have to take before you graduate, unless of course it's a requirement.  It really is just a programming class.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I have no plans to take OS and I'm not sure when I'm going to use C again.  The general theme of this course was \"trust me - this will all be useful later.\"  As a result, the subject was as uninspiring as it gets, unless you happen to love learning about large amounts of syntax and technicalities of programing languages.  \r\n\r\nThe best part of the course was the labs (programming assignments).  They were very well written were never had ambiguities.  These assignments are the same every semester, and solutions are provided immediately after the deadline.  Though this technically makes it very easy to cheat, keep in mind that the labs are the core of this class, and there's no point in taking it if you're not interested in working through each of them.  Because they were so detailed, they could be a bit overwhelming to read the first time through, and it is very important to follow the instructions to the letter.  Ultimately, they were very enjoyable to work through, and I can honestly say I learned almost everything that I learned in this class from working through the assignments.  Rubrics were provided for each lab that clearly stated how points were awarded.  \r\n\r\nI personally didn't find the lectures that I attended all that helpful.  The ones at the chalkboard gave good introductions to topics, and I profited the most from these.  He'd often go over something too quickly, and then be asked to repeat it three or four times more.  Occasionally, he'd repeat a large portion of the previous lecture, though it was impossible to tell when he would do that.  Ultimately, it was clear that he made the effort, but had trouble keeping everyone in the large classroom on the same page.  There were a lot of times when he'd explain something simple, or say \"you remember this from last time, right?\" and then five minutes later someone would raise their hand and ask about it.  When he did hour-long demos from the computer with the lights out, I found it very difficult to focus.  I'd always try to follow along with him, inevitably miss one step and therefore be lost for the rest of the demo.  \r\n\r\nThe pacing was also strange, as the last three weeks were the only time we spent programming in C++.  Almost the entire first half of the semester was dedicated to the C language, and the remaining time was spent on systems programming in C.  I understand that the training in C might be important for people who plan to take OS, but for everyone else it seemed like overkill.  \r\n\r\nI really never got the point of the whole YAXing policy.  Looking back, the deadline for every lab besides the first one was extended, and roughly half were extended twice.  Sometimes, the announcement of the extension was within 24 hours of the original deadline.  Talking to previous students and looking at CULPA reviews, I see that he's been doing this same practice since he started teaching.  I can't help but wonder why.  It would make a lot more sense for him to just tell us how long we truly had for the assignment so that we could plan ahead.  At this point in teaching the class, he probably knows how long he actually plans to give the class for assignments. \r\n\r\nThe mailing list was something about which I seemed to have the minority opinion.  I was really not a fan of it.  It might've worked better with a smaller class, but for a class of 140 students it bordered on absurd.  There was so much showing off and subtle attempts to suck up to Jae.  Some attempts were not subtle at all; for example, when the final exam solutions were mailed out, one student sent out an email saying that the exam was very well designed, and that this was the best course he had ever taken.  People would also use the mailing list to tell the class about how they went further and did additional work.  \r\n\r\nThe worst part of this class, and by far the most frustrating, was the evaluation process.  Jae said on the first day that it is very difficult to write an exam that assess what we truly know.  After seeing last semester's exams, it is clear that he is making the exams substantially more difficult by the semester.    He always said that working independently through the labs was the best way to prepare.  As someone who did just that, I can frankly say I've never felt so unprepared for exams as I was in this class.  The issue wasn't my approach to the labs, nor was it that I wasn't studying hard enough.  The midterm was about the same length as the final even though the final was given during final exam period.  There were a total of 17 questions on the final, and every single one of them was either a (very) short answer or multiple choice, with absolutely no partial credit under any circumstances (and trust me, there were plenty of places to mess up).  Questions would be asked on code fragments that were as long as 3 pages.  Single short problems would often test 5 ideas at once and carried a high all-or-nothing point value.  To add insult to injury, there would be multiple questions testing the same trick.  It seemed crazy to me that single trick multiple choice questions carried the same amount of weight as entire programming assignments.  The only reason I didn't feel worse when walking out of an exam where I had to make a semi-educated guess on most questions was because I knew that no amount of preparation would've been sufficient.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the final curve is very generous, with half of the class receiving at least an A-, and this will save you at the end of the semester if you work hard and have the right amount of luck.  The grades on both exams truly ranged from 0 (yes, zero) to 100, with the median on each around a 50.",

When I saw he was teaching again after he got his PhD, I was like YES, and now at the end, I'm just like meh. \r\n\r\nWell, the start was good. He set up a listserv to encourage class participation where students could ask questions and interact with TAs and other students. Everything was explained slowly for people who have never been exposed to C, but then he started to get behind on his lectures. That was sort of when things started going down hill. The labs were fun, but he would not have covered the material for them, and so he had to rush in class to cover what we needed to know on the labs, rather than take a good amount of time explaining things. Inevitably, he would have to YAX (yet another extension) them so he allowed people a reasonable amount of time to finish them. He also changed the labs from counting 40% of the course grade to 15%, which in my opinion has hurt a lot of people. We spend A LOT of time on doing the labs, which is why I think they should count more. That's where we do most of our learning, and where we can demonstrate we have an understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was really hard. After he gave us the midterm from fall 2011, which seemed very doable, the actual midterm was a disaster. The average was a 50 with a standard deviation of like 23. As someone who did well on the labs, I figured I was going to be fine on the midterm, but when I saw the midterm, I panicked because it seemed incomprehensible. I feel like I could have done a lot better. \r\n\r\nThe second half of the class felt rushed. The C++ things seemed VERY rushed. The last two labs are C++ oriented. Honestly, I'm on the verge of taking the final and still don't feel like I know that much about C++.\r\n\r\nI think Jae was very stressed this semester with a class of almost 200 people and that detrimentally affected his teaching ability.

However, he spent almost half of the semester just teaching C language and as a result, the rest of lectures (netcat, building a web server, C++, etc) were very rushed. Many of my friends who had no knowledge of how web servers work struggled. Example codes and other references were provided but was hard to consume even after attending Jae's lectures.\r\n\r\nGrading was fair since there was no partial credit on midterm or final, but because of that, it did not truly reflect how much a student understood the material. Median grade for almost all labs were perfect grade--so labs did not affect your grade that much if you're in the top 50%, the average grade for midterm was very high while the avg for final was around 60, which made the final exam the only differentiating factor of the grade for most of the students. Also, even though the final covered materials from about 6~7 labs, the test only focused on 2~3 labs and *everything* was one word answer with no description allowed--no coding, no partial credit, etc, which penalized students who \"almost got it\" very heavily.\r\n\r\nOne thing that made Jae's class great was its clean organization. The organization of lectures (order, increasing level of difficulty, etc), mailing list, rubric for grading each labs, lecture notes and lab manuals were all very useful and carefully crafted.

I started from knowing the functions I would need for the labs to Googling everything. Thankfully there's stackoverflow and cplusplus. He would also always extend the lab due dates to reasonable dates for everyone.\r\n\r\nTests were fair. He emphasizes that doing the labs on your own and understanding what's really going on will be the best preparation for the exams, and he means it. I didn't need to study much else beyond reviewing the lab solutions.\r\n\r\nJae also set up a course listserv in which he (Jae), the TAs, and the students could all participate.

Some (actually most) would say there really is no teaching being done, and going to class is just to find out what things you have to go on the internet/break open the books to learn yourself. This is completely true. Be prepared to scour the interwebs for tutorials and the sort if you are as unfamiliar to PERL and C as I was. \r\n\r\nOn to the class...\r\n\r\nThe class... was really what you made of it. I usually went to lecture because it was closer than my dorm from the class I had right before it. They were ok and I'm sure if I was the diligent notetaking type I would have gotten a little more out of the class than i did. But be prepared to get sidetracked, because like every lecture, there will be dumb questions being asked (once, some kid asked a question where the answer was literally on the slide we were on). Normally this isn't a big deal, but Shlomo has a tendency to stop and continue on that tangent. I think we've finished 3 lectures without him putting on a flipbook presentation of the last 20 slides in the 3 mins at the end of class. \r\n\r\nThe lab (not the assignments) was surprisingly enjoyable. I did spend much of my time there laughing and fumbling with the assignments, but having people there who ostensibly were there to help you was a tiny bit calming. Unfortunately, if you actually NEED help, then good luck. I'm sure the TAs are very capable programmers, but like most people who can do, they really can't teach. Take this with a grain of salt, as each year the TAs change. Shlomo, while he is there for maybe the first half of the term, goes AWOL when shit gets real in C.\r\n\r\nThe one awesome thing that I particularly enjoyed about Shlomo (no sarcasm) is that he is super lenient with deadlines.

For example, he promised for weeks on end to set up virtual servers for the group projects. In the end, he never did (nor did he tell the class that he had changed his mind, so some students were left hanging). Since we had no virtual servers, the only way for us to collaborate on the projects was for one partner to give the other his password(!). \r\n\r\nWorse, the projects are built to encourage horrible programming practices. He doesn't just allow them - he encourages and sometimes requires them. For example: we store our data in flat text files, rather than databases. For example: \r\n\r\n1. We were not allowed to use 'make install' to install external modules; we had to move the files into place manually. \r\n2. We were not allowed to use MOOSE to do object-oriented programming in Perl (because he 'didn't want to have to learn MOOSE'). Forget that nowadays all Perl object-oriented programming uses MOOSE.\r\n3. For example: we were told to use C/C++ to implement CGI scripts (which are themselves outdated), instead of using Perl, which we had already learned. C is the only language that doesn't support strings natively, so why would string manipulation be our first introduction to C, as well as our only major project in C?\r\n4. We were essentially prevented from using version control for the group project, as well as the individual assignments.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the syllabus was last revised in 1995. There is no reason to be teaching Perl anymore - and if it should be taught, we shouldn't be spending more than half the semester on it (as we did). If CGI scripts are believed relevant (which they really aren't), then they shouldn't be written in C. Webthumb is a script that nobody has used outside the Columbia CS curriculum since 1997. This is supposed to be the class where you learn about important tools like version control, shell scripting, and the like. In Hershkop's class, you'll learn none of these. \r\n\r\nGrading is slow to the point of providing no useful feedback whatsoever. By the time you get each lab back, you'll have turned in three more. I'll be surprised if we get the grades for the midterm project before we take the final (which looks unlikely at this point).\r\n\r\nIn short, there was nothing redeeming about this class. Prof. Hershkop takes an imperfect syllabus and manages to make it even worse. It's clear that he doesn't put much thought into the class - most of the time on the assignments is spent trying to debug the typos in his sample code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDijkstra once said, 'The teaching of BASIC should be rated as a criminal offence: it mutilates the mind beyond recovery'. But if you ever have the chance to learn BASIC as an alternative to taking this class, by all means, go for it. It'll damage your programming career less than Hershkop's class would.",

I decided to take the class because I wanted to learn C and C++ before going into my internship for the summer. Little did I know that most of the class would be perl, perl, and more perl. Out of the 10 labs for that class, six were about perl, two were about C, and two were about C++. \r\n\r\nThe only things he really covered about C were pointers and memory management. Obviously, good memory management is important and one of the trickiest parts of programming in C, but I really wish we went more in-depth. \r\n\r\nMost of the labs on perl centered around CGI programming, which is kind of pointless nowadays unless you're going to work for Amazon. There were also CGI parts to the C and C++ labs, which is even more pointless. If you are a Computer Engineering major like me or are on the systems track for CS, I highly suggest that you wait until someone else is teaching it. \r\n\r\n",

                "content": "I'll be blunt: Angelos Keromytis is not a good instructor. He might be pretty smart and know his stuff, but he just has no idea how to be a professor (sometimes literally; there was a period of 5 or 6 classes where I didn't see him at all and the TAs taught both the lab and lecture classes). \r\n\r\nA good professor spends time crafting detailed but concise slides with concrete, succinct examples; Keromytis copies code off the web and pastes them into his slides as if they were his own. (Seriously, Google the code. You'll find the exact same contrived examples online that only seldom work; most of the time they'll only serve as basic skeletons of what you need to do to get your code to compile.)\r\n\r\nA good professor is welcoming and encourages student participation and questions; Keromytis is intimidating and sometimes even humiliates students. For example, about 3/4ths of the way through the course, when a student wasn't sure how to change permissions on a file, instead of replying something reproaching but nevertheless sane such as, \"Use the chmod command, as we've been doing for the past two months,\" Keromytis responded, \"Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?\" This is not a good way to encourage students to keep asking questions. As if asking questions helped most of the time (see next paragraph).\r\n\r\nA good professor teaches and presents students concepts and ideas; Keromytis' ego comes across more than his material, and when asked questions, tells you to just look at the man page. Due to both the nature of this course and the professor's incomplete slide examples and his poor teaching abilities, you'll have a lot of questions about what to do. However, half the time when asked something about a particular C function or paradigm, either on Courseworks discussions or in class, Keromytis will just tell you to refer to the man page. While I understand that this class is supposed to mold you into a competent programmer who is fearless of elaborate technical documentation, there is something worthwhile about having a human being explain something to you rather than just reading it online or on a man page, and a good professor shouldn't just tell you to refer to something else nearly all the time. ..Although this professor might be an exception. I feel like I've learned more through Stack Overflow than Keromytis could ever hope of teaching me.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the only saving grace in this class were the two TAs. They seem to be the only ones that cared about us. They would take the time to read through our code line-by-line, helping us find bugs, and they would actually help clarify concepts. Their accents were a bit hard to get through at first, and the English and grammar in the assignments were sometimes confusing (since they wrote them all), but they mean no harm and will gladly clarify if you ask. Not to mention if you write to them about a specific bad grade you received and give reasonable arguments for why you think you deserved more credit, they will entertain your request, and if you present a good enough argument, this usually entails you getting at least one or two points back.\r\n\r\nI might sound bitter, but don't think this is because I got a bad grade. I didn't. Keromytis is just an astoundingly poor specimen of a professor. I got a good grade in the class, but it was due to my own hard work and the hours I put into labs and homeworks. I wish I could say Keromytis helped me along the way. I can't.",

You need to eat, sleep, and breathe Advanced Programming (especially if you take it concurrently with Data Structures--a poor choice, in my opinion. Both have heavy workloads). Whenever you have spare time, work on your lab and homework. Especially during weeks when homeworks are due, since these would often be due 2-3 days after a lab, in order to keep the labs on schedule.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final are both in the CLIC lab and are programming assignments. Midterm was doable (avg 68%) but final was difficult (avg 59%). It had two parts, one in C and one in PHP. The C part relied on one concept we learned for basically one lecture, and if this didn't work, the entire part wouldn't work. Protip for exams: when you reach bottlenecks like this, stop messing with it and spend your time wisely by coding other features, even though they may not be testable due to the aforementioned bottleneck.

I put almost exactly these notes in the little box on Courseworks, and I fervently pray that somebody in the department reads them.\r\n\r\nI feel bad for Prof. Hershkop. I really do. The way this course is designed -- or, at least, the way he seems to envision it -- it's impossible for an ordinary mortal to teach (Jae Lee, I'm told by his rapturous former students, is made of a different stuff than the rest of us, but that's a discussion for another day). 3157 requires its instructors to have an intimate knowledge of C, C++, make, Perl, Ruby, HTML, CSS, HTTP, CGI, memory, security, obscurity, etc. Not an impossible list of things to learn, but for somebody whose real work only deals with two or three of them, perhaps a bit unreasonable.\r\n\r\nDear Shlomo, unfortunately, isn't up to the task. His knowledge of web standards seems to end in about 1998 (he suggested that a problem with one of my labs, ultimately traced to bad server configuration, was because I wrote my newlines as &lt;br /&gt; rather than &lt;br&gt;). Ditto stylesheets. As for the unfortunate Ruby / RoR lecture, he was forced to resort to a mortifying game of \"spot-the-error\" with the class to cover up for the fact that he was completely clueless about variable scope in Rails controllers. Not everything was wasted -- I feel like I have a pretty solid knowledge of Perl, and the course was a useful C / C++ refresher for me.\r\n\r\nBut my real problem is this: He loves webapps, but in an effort to come up with \"applications\" for the things we learn in class, Prof. Hershkop assigns projects that actively encourage VERY BAD DESIGN PRACTICES.\r\n\r\nFor example: In order to avoid adding a brief intro to relational databases to the already-groaning syllabus, students are encouraged to do everything with flat file databases. Nobody even mentions the fact that this is fundamentally unscalable.\r\n\r\nFor example: The entire second project required us to write vast numbers of CGI scripts in C++. Hardly anybody uses CGI anymore, and they sure as hell don't write the scripts in C++ when they do.\r\n\r\nFor example: Some of the labs instructed us to write Makefile jobs not to compile our code, but to run it.\r\n\r\nFor example: we were forced to repeatedly work with a nasty little script called webthumb. At this very moment, there are a hundred copies of Firefox running in a hundred X server sessions spawned by a hundred instances of webthumb because some poor sod never found all the bugs in his copy of webthumb. There are many better ways to do this, but apparently part of being an Advanced Programmer is remaining wedded to long-dead technologies, even when superior alternatives exist.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I hope my point is clear. I think there is a place for this class within the CS major, but it needs to be slimmed down, modernized and a little less webapp-happy.",

It's quite ridiculous when people turn in homework a month late with no penalty.\r\n2. Typos. He can't even add. The points on the homework never add up and his slides are full of errors.\r\n3. Boring! He teaches from slides and doesn't engage students well. I fall asleep (it was a 9 am class though)\r\n4. Useless homework. Most assignments are pointless and not useful. You won't get much out of the course, except learning how to debug webthumb. What's that you say? Exactly - pointless! Those who took the class know what I'm talking about. \r\n5.

I later found out most of the slides were taken straight off of books, other websites, man pages, etc. As a matter of fact the only good lectures were those where we had guest lecturers.\n\nHe tended to be somewhat condescending in reponse to questions and requests and I got the impression that he was intentionally misinterpreting the question to make you dumb when in fact that was not the question at all.\n\nHis labs and homeworks were generally repetitive and again uninspiring. Many of the labs and homeworks were repetitions of one another or just annoyingly tedious...sort of like asking someone to do long division to the 100th decimals.\nOverall, the worst CS class I've ever taken in my life.",

Professor Sklar is the nicest person in the world and will do everything in her power to help you if you actually go to her. She is pretty quiet, and won't come to you, even if she thinks you're doing badly. If seek her out though, I have never seen a professor go to such lengths to help her students. She even has an aim sn just to help students on the nights before big assignments are due. She is usually a little bit late everywhere but she's a fine lecturer and presents the material she has to present clearly (ps people complaining about her writing code on the board a lot, all of the code up there is usually on the website). \nThe class however, is a complete nightmare. None of the annoying weekly labs are that hard, and the homeworks are definitely resonable, but you switch languages every week. I suppose if you really know you're stuff (ie you've programmed in pretty much all of the languages others have mentioned some before) you can skip a bunch of the lectures and labs and do fine in the class. However, even if you're a major, if you're just taking the class right after 1007/1004 you're going to be in pain (even if you did well, I got an A in 1007). And looking up syntax/googling everything for all of the assignments all all the time. The department is pretty ridiculous to expect second semester majors with limited experience to do very well in the course. \nMoral of the story: unless you're programmer extraordinare go to office hours and make lots of friends you can run to at 3am for help",

The point of reviewing this course is more to alert students who are going take it to some of the difficulties they may face (she's teaching it again Spring 2003). That said, Prof. Sklar is not a bad teacher--not at all, especially when compared to many other SEAS and Physics/Chem/Math professors. For the most part she means well and is quite flexible and open. I think the main problem with the course was the overly aggressive syllabus--which has more to do with the CS department and the unfortunate fact that it is pretty much still experimental than with Prof. Sklar herself. Officially, the course is to \"better prepare students for courses like OS and Networks\". However I felt it was trying to cover such and such topics just so that the department can suppose we know them when in reality we only know _about_ them. _In short, in this class the syllabus is more important than you_. As with most other CS classes, there are some very prepared people with extensive C and UNIX and internet programming backgrounds who find the course and the lectures a joke. The ultra-motivated student with a lot of time in their hands may enjoy the \"sink-or-swim-ness\" by swimming very hard and doing a lot of reading and experimenting on their own. The average student may also do well by doing the bare minimum and choosing cheesy ways out in programming assignments but will unlikely feel satisfied with the experience.",

And instead of teaching us C++ which would have actually built off of our knowledge of C, she tried to teach us CGI in one day, javascript in one day... you get the idea. Of course it isn't entirely her fault that there is too much information in too short a time. This class was a bad, bad idea. The only perk is that the game, once done and all unnecessary elements for the purposes of the homework are removed, will probably be cute.

As a graduating senior heading out into the computer science workforce, I found the presentation of a broad range of topics very helpful. Though Prof. Shulzrinne didn't have time to go into great depth about any one topic (except maybe C programming), I felt that the overviews given (along with references to website where we could get more info) gave me a much better understanding of the tools & languages that are out there and what can be done with them. Other people in the class hated how we had to go searching for documentation around the web to find how to do certain things, but I thought it was actually very good preparation for the \"real world\" of software development jobs, where research of this kind is an essential part of the job. The class was taught exclusively with PowerPoint slides, which at times were the same as reading \"man\" pages, but Prof. Schulzrinne did provide a lot more related information in class (i.e. go to class). I don't know if the class really should be a replacement for softe, because (having taken that prior to this course), I found they were both useful, and that students will probably get more out of AP if it is taken after softe. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I need to commend Prof. Schulzrinne on his accessiblity (via e-mail). He answered all of the [many] questions that came to the e-mail mailing list, and always seemed to reply to e-mails very quickly. How many other professors do you know who would write back to you within an hour when you send an e-mail to him at 12:05 AM on a Saturday morning??",

This is the first time it was given, so expect some changes, but it covers a bunch of real tools in the marketplace, such as BASH, C, XML, SOAP, RPM, TKL, among many others. Its also apparently looked at as a precursor to Operating Systems for students who like to focus on coding instead of the theories behind it. What happens as the semester goes on, however, is that the usefullness of the subjects as they're taught varies inversely with their actual importance in the \"real world\". The class ends up wandering aimlessly as Schulzrinne simply presents bits and pieces of each subject through his powerpoint presentations. Then when homeworks come around, they're often on subjects hardly covered in class, and you're expected to google your way to tutorials provided elsewhere. This is especially the case with XML/Java (an very active & useful topic), where a few scant lecture slides leave you with nothing useful for the homework, and you end up learning it as though you're not even in a class that's supposed to teach it! Oreilly books to the rescue! When Schulzrinne ventures into talking about the marketplace of OpenSource vs PeopleSoft vs Proprietary and the like its like reading a weeks worth of slashdot. It occured to me that the people that are the most interesting to listen to on those subjects are out in the industry actually shaping their fates, not in the classroom. The bottom line is that, common to other Schulzrinne reviews on CULPA, he expects you to learn it based largely on unspecified non-class materials. And common to most all CS classes I've taken, the HWs serve as a good lesson in doing the HW, not necessarily in learning the subject (to be fair, the C assignments were a bit better as we spent about 5 weeks with it). I finish each one thinking about how next time I have to use whatever tool I'm going to have to learn the syntax mostly from the beginning anyway. The syllabus will probably improve after it gets reviewed a couple times, but the core experience is not much more educational than getting a linux machine and playing with these technologies on your own time. The only difference is that here you'll get a grade and 3 credits for it. I don't know if its better than softe, but from conversations I've had with friends it sure sounds like there's significantly less work and stress.",

Class examples are the foundations but for homework problems you need to learn how to apply your base knowledge. Also reviewing for exams is less about how many problems you do and more about deeply understanding the concepts and solutions for the problems you do. Discrete problems require a level of creativity, so it's more important to just understand what's going on than to crank out extra practice. Problem sets were pretty time-consuming and for harder units like Mod I had to self-study external material to understand. Definitely utilize your resrouces: go to TA and professor office hours. He's hard but fair. I would say take him if you are generally curious, like a challenge, and don't mind putting in the time outside of class to deeply understand the content.

I found him to be very nice but not a very good lecturer or teacher, I had to go to office hours or spend time teaching myself everything in this class from online resources because he taught with very vague examples or just didn't teach things needed for the homework. Along with that he would always say to start the homework early and would give assignments 2 weeks beforehand, but wouldn't teach concepts needed to do a lot of those problems until sometimes the class before it was due. Overall, I just felt like this class was made intentionally difficult when it didn't need to be, and he should have spent more time teaching basic concepts thoroughly as well as actually teaching what we needed for the homework. This class to me exemplifies everything wrong with classes at Columbia. Especially given that this is a 4 credit class, I expected a lot more and definitely better organization.

There were so many times where Dear or the TAs gave out hints, or changed the question, or gave other ways of solving it because it was too damn hard. I clearly remember going to Dear himself to ask a HW question, and even he had to think about it a lot before he could help me. Unfortunately, hard HWs mean even harder exams. The midterms weren't too bad, but the final literally ruined me. I guessed on like half of the questions and wanted to give up. I solidly thought I failed the course.\n\nWhat's unfortunate is that I love math, and I think I would have really enjoyed this course if the problems were not so difficult. I get that we're trying to be challenged, but at what cost?\n\nIf you are conflicted between taking the course with Dear or Ansaf, I'd say you will learn more with Dear, but have a harder time and probably a lower grade than if you take it with Ansaf.\n\nAlso, this is not to crap on Dear. He is very nice and kind, but I think he doesn't realize how hard his problems are sometimes. It also doesn't help that the TAs make the HWs sometimes and they underestimate the difficulty.\n\nHow to do well (or, at least, not fail):\n-Go to the TAs or Dear for HW help. This will save you.\n-Fully understand the answers on the practice exams.\n-Use textbook problems for the first 2 midterms, but then AI generated problems will help you more for the final.\n-Focus on scoring as high as possible on the HWs (meaning, pretend they are the most important things ever)\n-Don't give up.\n-Know that this is a hard course taught by a hard professor.\n\nMy grade breakdown:\nHW total: slightly above average\nM1: below average\nM2: average\nFinal: below average\nRaw score: 75% (this was curved to a B+)\n\nTL;DR: Don't give up, but also be aware that this is a hard course to begin with.

It was insanely hard to make logical leaps from what was learned in class and apply it to the homework and I spent more time trying to understand what some problems were even asking then solving them. Multiple homework assignments had incorrect information or confusing and roundabout prompts to trick or confuse you maybe but just lead to questions that didn't make any sense. The first exam was reasonably difficult but the average was around an 80. Professor Dear saw this as his opportunity to increase the difficulty even further with the average on the second exam being around a 50. The excuse for the problems being insanely difficult was because it was open note but there were a couple problems that used formulas that didn't even exist in the notes and weren't covered in lecture. The final exam had a similar result. While the class was heavily curved in the end, I feel I didn't deserve the A- I somehow ended up getting because I feel I still don't understand half the concepts we covered in class because of the brutal difficulty and terrible experience. This class has turned me off of all future theoretical CS classes at Columbia. I would not recommend Professor Dear for any class as I heard this is a common experience.

Ansaf did a terrific job adapting the course to an online format.  \nI am talented at math (A+ in the course) but still got a lot out of the course.  I think prior reviewers do future students a disservice by saying the class is too easy.  \nSo here are the exam stats for my semester: midterm average was 88.6 and the final exam average was 78.4.  Clearly many students struggled with the material on the final exam.  It was a very fair exam -- my point is that the class is not trivial if you really want to master it.     \nSome students have said that it is easy to hurt your score by making a careless mistake. The class is not akin to a heavy computational Ordinary Differential Equations course where a single mistake is easy to make and will throw you off. If you are making mistakes on the problems in this class, you generally do not have a perfect understanding of the concepts. And these are key concepts in mathematics.      \nIf you actually pay attention in lecture, read the notes, and also read the text (the Scheinerman text is solid), you will learn a few important concepts even if you have a solid math background.  And these are very key concepts in math.  The coding assignments are good Python practice. \nEven if you place out of the course, I would recommend taking it.  It's a very crucial course in one's intellectual development and it's enjoyable.",

I will agree with one thing from other reviews: Prof Ansaf is a really nice person.\nGrading literally took ages, with no communication from the TAs or the Prof on why it took nearly a month to get our assignments graded. This made it difficult to see what I needed to work on, and also strategize if I should skip the last assignment or not (since the lowest assignment is dropped).\nThe Head TA for this semester was, to put it nicely, rude. That is the nicest word that comes to mind based on their class-wide announcements and personal interactions. I'm sure they're smart and are very knowledgeable on the subject matter at hand - but their communication skills when interacting with students are poor.\nThat said.. there are some things I really enjoyed:\n\nGenerous final grade, +2 pts if you submit something on time, implementation of Python coursework is a great addition to the course, allowing 'coding group' to work on a coding assignment together was a great way to meet new people in a virtual environment.\nCaveat: I took this class in Fall '20 in the middle of the pandemic.

Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\nI will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, it\u2019s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snail\u2019s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full week\u2019s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I don\u2019t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\nOn the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know you\u2019ll need Discrete in the future.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not sure if I can recommend Ansaf\u2019s version of Discrete. It\u2019s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesn\u2019t require a ton of work, but don\u2019t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes. If you have the option of testing out, I think doing so and taking a more advanced course in its place would be a better use of your time unless you desperately need the GPA boost.",

Really, despite all the comments written below I still think that it is unfair to moke professor only because she is a naturally kind person. She was always approachable and her course was extremely well organized.\r\n\r\nOrganization:\r\n- first of all, you can see all the topics she is going to cover on courseworks from the very first day of the class\r\n- you can also see the dates of upcoming exams/midterms to organize your schedule (you may think that it is always the case but once you get more experience with Columbia, you may realize that it is NOT)\r\n- there were always availability of lecture notes handwritten and typed (also very helpful and rare at Columbia)\r\n- there are two books for this class which cover all the material but students usually do not notice the existence of the second one: it is only for \"inference topic\" but you do not have to buy it. All of them are always available at the library \r\n\r\nOHs:\r\nI personally never went to OH and I cannot say anything about TAs for this class, but the overall organization was so great that I even didn't have to! Everything was in books and lecture notes. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nMidterms were great: you can have a cheat sheet with formulas you may forget. Then you do not need to study formulas: you basically have to UNDERSTAND the material. Moreover, it consists of numerous small problems: it never happens that the problem is worth 40-50-60% of the exam (as it happens in other classes: but you realize it again only with more experience at Columbia).\r\nThat is why when you cannot solve something - you still will be fine.\r\n\r\nOverall feeling:\r\nIt was the only course where you didn't need to stress out and be scared as hell before exams if you missed a lecture because everything was organized so well that another student even didn't need to go to a lecture. Probably, that is why everybody decided not to attend lectures and then to complain.\r\n\r\nTeaching style:\r\nThis class is big: one section is around 150 students. And it is always hard to explain material if there are so many people. \r\nIf you go to the lecture and keep attention to what the professor explains - you will definitely enjoy her teaching style.\r\nIf you stay in the last row and spent half of the lecture on facebook - you probably will not enjoy her teaching style.\r\nThat is why to enjoy this class I would suggest to go to the lecture and try to listen to the professor, to attend her OHs: \r\nit is the only way you will really enjoy the Discrete. Believe me, Ansaf is great: you just have to keep attention to what she is saying. \r\nIn any case, if compared to other classes, you always will be well equipped with all the materials needed.  ",

Although she does post power point slides summarizing what she teaches in lecture, they are a fair amount of helpful examples that she goes over in class which are not included in the power points. These in-class examples are also closely aligned with what she puts on the exams. The overall consensus within the department is that Ansaf is a nice person, but a so-so teacher. This is true. Her lectures were average in every respect: organization, clearness, etc. I was a student that always asked questions in class and she was always willing to stop what she was doing, unlike other professors, to answer my question and make sure I understood. \r\n\r\nHomework: Took me about 5-7 hours for every homework assignment. If I got stuck, I would go to the TA office hours for help\u2014at OH, the TAs (at least the ones I went to) were incredibly helpful and often just gave me the answer. Homework is doable if you pace yourself, ask for help from your friends/TAs at OH/TAs on Piazza. \r\n\r\nExams: The exams are EASIER than the homework, and as I said before the questions on the exams are closely aligned with the ones she goes over in lecture (again, go to lecture). \r\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this class. Ansaf's kindness/approachability, combined with a generous curve, make this class worth taking despite the fact that her teaching is so-so. You will learn. ",

Lots of partial credit on exams as well. Overall pretty easy class.\r\n\r\nHowever, the actually teaching quality has a high variance.

I tried seeking out extra help through the TAs of the course (generally CS TAs are incredibly helpful and patient). But every other day we would get emails informing us that the TAs would unexpectedly cancel their hours. Like COME ON. (I'm also a TA for a bio class and I've canceled my hours before but every other day is excessive). Also, I've been to multiple TA sessions (I've sometimes woken up at 7AM to make the 8AM session) only to have the TA NOT SHOW UP. SERIOUSLY??? This class was just so incredibly frustrating. Lastly, I do not find Professor Vovsha to be a kind or helpful professor.

Which is that she is an incompetent teacher w.r.t. teaching concepts that students are not already familiar with. For students with a strong mathematical background, this is no problem, because, as previous reviews have mentioned, this class covers more breadth than depth. But because of the increase in CS majors, there's a corresponding increase in students in the class who haven't had as rigorous a math background. For us, Dawn's explanations leave a lot (everything) to be desired. She frequently backtracks, corrects herself, and equivocates when answering questions, e.g. (in response to a student's question) \"Well, you're right if we're on the same page,\" which is a non-answer, or \"If you're confused just try the practice problems on this at home,\" which defeats the purpose of going to class. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the class seems to be split into students who have seen everything except graph theory before and students who have seen none of it means that, at least this semester, the latter were afraid to ask questions, which Dawn read as comfort with the material rather than confusion about the concepts (and/or the motivation for them). Disappointing, because I feel like the subject could be rewarding as taught by a teacher good at working with large audiences.\r\n\r\nAvoid Dawn's section of this class if you can.",

He gave us a study guide and said that what wasn't on the study guide would not be on the exam. That wasn't true: one problem asked to use a formula that didn't appear on the study guide.

Professor Strickland will stop to take every question and it's a large class so expect to spend a lot of time listening to things repeated over and over again. The homeworks are pretty easy and all done through CourseWorks so a textbook is not necessary unless you want to do the practice problems she recommends, which are only worth it if you don't have a decent math background because the homework and test questions can all be solved using the same techniques used on examples in class. If you're the kind of person who prefers to read the textbook - just buy it and don't go to class. The tests are pretty easy if you enjoy math and more than enough time is allotted. An honors class in the subject really should be offered but in the meantime, enjoy the easy A if math is your thing.

                "content": "Firstly, as the previous reviews have stated, Dawn Strickland is one of the nicest professors you can have. She is very friendly and approachable and will gladly answer any questions you have. However, I have several gripes with the course (not necessarily with Dawn herself).\r\n\r\nTo start, the textbook for the class is garbage (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen). It's full of convoluted examples with little explanation for how the problems are solved. The information is conveyed in the most elaborate terms, and once the material gets difficult, it is extremely difficult to understand. I think the textbook really needs to be changed. Just check out the Amazon reviews for it: http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0073383090\r\n\r\nSecondly, the optional homework comes straight from the book. I'm certain that almost nobody did it, because (1) it's optional, and (2) the book is no good. There are no quizzes in the class either, so your grade is entirely dependent upon the exams.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dawn's lectures are well-structured and pretty informative. You can learn most of the easier material just by going to lecture. However, once the material got harder, I couldn't understand much of what was going on in class. To study for the exams, I pretty much just Googled what I needed to know from the book and then took her practice exam.\r\n\r\nMy last gripe is this. I actually did well on the exams and got a good grade in the class- however, I cannot say that I know much of anything about Discrete Math. I really don't feel like I learned anything from the course. If you asked me what Discrete Math is and why it's important, I couldn't tell you. I studied in a way that allowed me to do well on the exams for some reason, but I'm still confused about much of the material and really was not satisfied with the course.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, I don't think it's hard to get a good grade in the class. It just wasn't a very pleasant experience, and I feel like the course needs a major overhaul.",

                "content": "In this review, I'm going to be very careful to distinguish between the content of the course and the instructor.  \r\n\r\nI can't say enough good things about Dawn both as a person and an instructor.  She is an excellent instructor who definitely took her role of teaching this class very seriously and did a great job teaching it.  She was always very well-prepared for lectures, easy to follow, and enthusiastic.  She's also very approachable and will take the time to answer questions and help students who are having trouble.  In class, rather than just doing math on the board, she makes a point to write out (in words) the steps that she is doing when they are confusing, which makes note-taking a lot more valuable.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I strongly believe that the CS department needs to rethink content of the course.  What I'm about to say applies to any section of this course taught at Columbia.  It covers a wide range of topics, and therefore doesn't have much time to go into depth on any of them.  This alone is not a problem, but what is a problem is that the course is way too easy, almost laughably so, for anyone who has a decent background in math.  This really would be a good course to have an honors version and a regular version (with both countable towards the CS major and minor).  Regardless of who you are, you'll probably learn something in this class.  However, some people will learn a lot more than others, and the course attempts to appeal to students who have had a wide range of mathematical backgrounds.  As someone with a relatively strong background, some of the questions I heard in class were cringe-inducing and painful to hear.  \r\n\r\nA detailed day-by-day syllabus is provided for the course.  I definitely recommend going to the lectures for the material you're trying to learn rather than attempting to learn it out of the book.  The latter is possible, but it's probably harder and more time-consuming than trying to learn from the book because the book is not very good.   Homework from the book was assigned but not collected.\r\n",

She literally didn't teach us anything this semester. She teaches the very basics of theory and does some problems in class. She assigns problems from the textbook that are harder than what she teaches in class. Her exams have problems which are harder than the textbook. This is a recipe for disaster. I think math classes should be taught in such a way that students get loads of practice and are tested at a level equal to what they are prepared for, not more. We also missed 3 classes this semester, so we didn't cover a lot of material.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I didn't learn much from this class. I feel under prepared for CS Theory.

While his lectures aren't always structured like they're coming from an outline you can copy down, they aren't boring and they do get the information across.  The point of Discrete Math is to make you learn to think through problems, and few problems in the real world just appear in your head with a clear path to get you from A-B-C-D-E.  If it were that easy, it wouldn't be a problem that you needed to learn how to solve.  When he lectures, he doesn't just go A-B-C-D-E, he tries to get you to think about the process behind getting to E.\r\n\r\nThe class covered a lot of material very fast, and it definitely helped if you had a rudimentary familiarity with things like statistics, logic, and counting.  But if you didn't he gave enough information that you should have been fine.\r\n\r\nHis lecturing style is a bit free flowing.  He seems to have an ordered list of a dozen or so things to get through each lecture, and will work through them.   He does enjoy occasional diversions to related topics.  He clearly likes the material and manages to keep what could be a very dry topic interesting.  He welcomes questions, and is one of the best professors I've seen at being able to explain concepts multiple ways when people don't grasp them.  If you ask a stupid question, he won't sugar-coat his response, but he won't out-right mock you either.  And in one-on-one interactions, he's great.  Very approachable.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, he was usually 5 minutes late to class, and there was a very long lag time for homework to be graded and returned.\r\n\r\nAnd he LOVES his definitions.

First, whether or not Adam Cannon taught the class well, and second whether or not it was hard and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nI can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the class and, as usual, found Adam Cannon to be an engaging and witty lecturer. It is true, he wasn't on cruise control as he is while teaching 1004, but he was still very good. His explanations were intuitive and clear and he realized that most people taking the class had not had previous exposure to a higher level of mathematics. As a result, he time again emphasized and explained to us, the importance of thinking truly mathematically as it were. In other words, he taught us to recognize the importance and place of proofs in mathematics and stated that while examples are often helpful, they are simply not adequate to understand abstract concepts completely. He sometimes proved theorems which were not in the book, so be aware of that and occasionally makes notational mistakes on the board so don't be afraid to point them out as he often doesn't notice them afterwards. I felt lost in only one of the lectures which was the one on solving liner homogeneous and non-homogeneous recurrence relations, I don't know what happened there but it seemed like Adam Cannon was having a monologue with the board for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn class, he asks interesting puzzles related to the material and will always give you an idea about the real-world applications of the concepts being covered. He is also just friendly and approachable. He has 4 office hours a week, which is more than most professors, although there is often a line so go early. Definitely go to office hours if you get stuck on the homeworks, he's more than happy to help. He'll rarely give away an answer but will certainly tell you how to approach any given problem.",

They were pretty long in an absolute sense, but given that we had two weeks to solve them, the length was by no means unreasonable. A quarter to a third of the problems in each assignment were proofs but most of these followed almost straightaway from the definitions. Writing proofs was hard at first for some people, but then again learning how to write basic proofs is half the point of the class. The bulk of the time-consuming problems are in the earlier part of the assignment so you can get started early during the 2 week period. One thing I did find was that the point distributions on the homeworks could be bizarre and some hard problems had very few points assigned to them. Also the TAs sometimes graded kind of harshly so if you think they overlooked something and your solution was correct, definitely go back to them and ask.\r\n\r\nMidterm was easy, the 2 proofs were perhaps the only tricky part. The final was cumulative and the questions were difficult. Lots of counting problems, 4 proofs  (3 of them manageable) and some modular arithmetic. 20 points is testing vocabulary so these are basically free points and you have to learn the definitions anyway in order to do well on the proofs. It also doesn't take all that long. According to him, the class is curved to a high B so about 30-40% of people get some sort of an A."

He cursorily goes over TONS material which he seems not to have mastered well himself, but succeeds at covering it up. He assigns EXTREMELY long problem sets that are proof heavy. Attending class was a major time-sink as he would be late for class, his lectures were unorganized and his class examples trivial, not helpful at all when it came to doing the problem sets.Though discrete math is a useful class, I disagree it is the most important (as Cannon appears convinced) and he should be more considerate of this view.\r\nThe midterm for the class was fair, but the final impossible. Of the many faults Cannon's teaching style has, the worst is probably the fact that the final is cumulative, with approximately 700 pages worth of material--including over 300 vocabulary words and proofs--to know by heart. \r\nStrongly consider taking discrete math with another teacher.",

First time teaching.\r\n\r\nNot the greatest teacher in my opinion; but for the first time teaching, not the worst. He stated repeatedly that he was limited by the lecture notes, that he was told by the Professor Gross to go straight from his lecture notes. Which he did. He did a decent number of examples, but he didn't do them very well, i.e. skipped a lot of steps. The concepts didn't really stick. If you wanted something clarified, however, he was very good at answering questions.\r\n\r\nThe things he covered in class often carried over to the test, but never to the homework. What the lectures were doing and what the book/homework emphasized were completely different. They didn't have much overlap.\r\n\r\nHe had abnormal ways of going about tests. He experimented with different ways to do review sessions over the web, i.e. TokBox, Google Wave. It was effective enough, I suppose. He answered the questions that people came up with, but it wasn't as easy to understand; it would've been easier if he did it on a chalkboard. Additionally, the way he grades: if you improve from the first test to the second test by at least 15 points, he'll take the higher of the two. But if you had higher on the first than the second, he won't change the scores. If he is your teacher, I would recommend going to class. Looking at the lecture notes tends not to be enough: he'll go into tangents, which he'll end up testing.\r\n\r\nHaven't taken the final, but it seems he plans to curve to either a B+ or an A-.\r\n\r\nHe has a tendency to go a bit too much into his personal life.

Almost certainly my favorite class this whole semester, but I can't quite figure out why.\r\n\r\nGross is absolutely brilliant -- there's no question about that. He just radiates a sort of aura of genius while he lectures. The class inevitably brings up questions about things that are peripheral to the course material: the incompleteness theorem, decidability, complexity, topology -- Gross can explain it all. But the CS department here is full of brilliant people, and none of them have (yet) inspired the same kind of reaction from me that Gross did.\r\n\r\nHis lectures and course notes are fantastic. Clear, concise, elegantly typeset -- you could learn all the material from only reading the online notes, or from only going to class and reading nothing at all. But Blaer is a great lecturer, and Allen's notes are just as good; again, I never looked forward to either of their classes as much.\r\n\r\nHe's digressive, but...actually, I don't think there's another lecturer in the department quite as digressive as Gross. And maybe that's the point. When your question about the well-definedness of negative moduli launches a fifteen minute discussion of how humans understand made-up words (and no answer to your question), you're learning. When you're treated to a lengthy description of the mechanisms used to solve the four-color problem or the Poincare conjecture, you're learning. The main content of his lectures teaches you discrete math, but the digressions teach you to think like a computer scientist.\r\n\r\nI think CS students here have a tendency to underestimate the usefulness of this class. If you are planning on doing anything in real computer science (and to a certain extent, even software engineering) discrete math is absolutely crucial. If you can't put together a proper inductive proof, you can't do CS Theory, and you can't do Analysis of Algorithms.  If you can't reason about graphs, then you'll never really understand what's going on in Data Structures or in Networks. I would have been helpless on the first Linear Algebra homework this semester were it not for the tools I picked up in this class...you get the point.\r\n\r\nThis is powerful stuff.

                "content": "Discrete Mathematics, as taught by Professor Grinspun, is a CS prerequisite I am very happy to be taking.  Professor Grinspun's computer graphics research is really cool, but that is outside the scope of this review.  The main strength of COMS W3203 is clarity.  Professor Grinspun's lectures are so understandable that I have not usually needed to read the textbook in depth.  If anything, they are too basic and move too slowly, although there is plenty of time to ruminate on the materials in class.  The textbook (by Kenneth Rosen) is also excellent, being both engaging and informative.  The difficulty and pacing of the course changed relatively little as the semester progressed, a teaching accomplishment in itself.    \r\n\r\nThe curriculum focuses roughly equally on proof-writing and problem-solving--a fair division, although I wish there had been more discussion of how Discrete Math can be applied.\r\n\r\nThe homework was where most of my learning took place, and it would have been a mistake not to do it as thoroughly as possible even if each assignment is only 4 percent of the grade.  (Not everyone does their homework thoroughly.)  Homework is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for preparing for the three exams, which are long and complicated exercises in problem-solving and proof-writing speed.  As a warning, almost no one could finish the second midterm exam.  This includes some of the best remaining students.  Fortunately, the exams' open-book nature and the grading curve meant they were actually easier than exams in many other classes.  The 6 homework assignments were 9 to 20 handwritten pages each, and each one usually took me 10-20 hours to finish.  Many questions were difficult, and office hours often saved me.  \r\n\r\nThis course has a high attrition rate--perhaps one-third to more than half of the original students choose to drop it after the first lecture, including some of Columbia's best and brightest.  There might be several reasons for this.  Professor Grinspun calls on students unannounced and does not hesitate to embarrass them (although I never saw him embarrassing anyone unprovoked).  Homework 1 was as difficult as the other assignments, which may have led some students to believe the course would be more demanding than it actually was.  The heavily proof-oriented nature of Discrete Math may also have scared off some.  In my opinion, DROPPING THIS COURSE INSTEAD OF PRESSING THROUGH IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.  My experience was that around week 4 of the course, proofs suddenly became less intimidating and around week 5 or 6, Professor Grinspun mellowed out.  What students contend with is a not especially time-consuming commitment, as CS courses go, and possibly one of the 5 best undergraduate courses in the CS department.  I enjoy it, and would strongly recommend it to students with the appropriate background (some introduction to programming such as COMS W1004; pre-calculus or, better yet, calculus; and, if you're really concerned about writing proofs, the supposedly well-taught Introduction to Higher Mathematics).",

His main problem is borne of his love of the subject - I think it's tough for him to relate to people who don't understand the material, so he has difficulty packaging things in a friendly way.  In fact, the material, both in the course notes that he teaches from and in the book, seems to have no regard whatsoever for the idea that mathematical concepts needn't be articulated in obtuse shorthand that caters to experts, not students in a class with the barest of prerequisites.  If you're having trouble with a concept, you'll probably have to see Prof. Gross in office hours and see one of the TAs and spend some time curled up with the book.\n\nProf. Gross teaches directly from course notes that he posts on the class website.  You should consider it pretty much a requirement that you print out the course notes before class and bring in the printouts to write on.  Otherwise you'll be scrambling to write stuff down in class, and you'll miss most of it.  If you print the course notes and read them and the assigned chapters in the book before each class, you'll have a much better idea of what's going on during the class.\n\nThe problem sets and exams are quite difficult.  You can count on having to run crying to the TAs on at least some of the problem sets, so you should leave time to do that before they're due.  Prof. Gross says he writes the exams aiming for a class average of about a 60.  They're open book and open notes though, so that helps.  He posts some old exams, so if you can do those very well (and you should, as practice), you'll be fine.\n\nIf your final average is in the high 70s, that should earn you an A-.",

The TAs said that Eitan was the nicest professor they've ever TAed for and it seems to me they were right, his tests and homework assignments were very very fair and he encouraged the TAs to be easy graders. It's probably a bad idea to skip the class unless you have a friend whose a good note-taker because he does go over material/ do the aforementioned really useful problems during lecture that aren't in the book.

The class is pretty easy if you're a CS/compE major but if you're having trouble with something Eitan's totally accesible and willing to help you.

He's an animated and entertaining lecturer who covers a lot of concepts with in-depth and interesting examples and applications (e.g. counting poker hands during the probability lectures). Everything you learn comes from the lectures-- the text was more of a backup and for homework exercies, and since they go by pretty quick, I'd say you have to be damn brilliant to not have to show up. I'm no math genius, so I found the material pretty difficult-- he'd often cover proofs in class that wouldn't sink in until I went though my notes and thought everything through much more slowly (and even then some  never fully did). Even so, it certainly wasn't impossible to grasp the concepts and be able to do well on the homework assignments and quizzes. Exams were really challenging (all in-class, 4-5 questions), consisting of completely original problems that required you to apply in new ways the skills acquired from lecture. Your success on exams, in my opinon, will largely depend on your mathematical creativity-- how flexible you can be in applying the concepts you know to a problem that's pretty different from what you've seen before. In my case, the particular way of working out some exam problems just would never have occurred to me (how to begin a proof, where to go next after you've reached a point, etc.), especially under the stress of an exam, so I did pretty bad on them. But they're curved pretty generously, and if you do well on homeworks, you can still do well in the course (and hard exams are nice-- they really get you to think). More important, though, the class is always interesting, and I think (especially if you haven't taken a course like it) you'll find yourself much better able to look into a problem then before.",

The course consists of some select topics which Gross does not like to go into depth in. The course itself covers a large number of topics, but none extremely deeply. Going to class is a waste of time except for his jokes, as he basically reads his notes (you can do this in the comfort of your dorm room). The homeworks are a joke as the solution manuals solve similar problems (only the numbers are changed around). The exams are also pretty easy as they are open book and open notes. An overly dumb SEAS contingency lowers the median so as long as you score about 95 or so on each midterm and the final, you are set for an A+.\n\nGross himself doesn't care if you learn the material, as he is not too available, but the TA's are somewhat better (they are like his bodyguards).",

I am a math major and only took the class because of the material covered in the class.  However, Prof. Gross is completely inept.  He has this attitude that he is a math genious and if students are naturally inclined in math they will understand his lectures, if not, tough on the student.  I agree that this course covers a huge array of topics and the class is very time pressured, but Gross makes minimal attempt to lecture well.  His notes that accompany the book are absolutely horrible and worthless (I learned the material from the book which is actually a very well written text).  Half of Gross' lectures are anecdotes from his life: he has told us numerous stories when he was a kid and how brilliant he was in math and other information about his life.  Also, he never writes on the blackboard (I have never seen this done especially since this is a MATH course...).  He explains the concepts poorly and rushes through topics that are very important (I guess I can't totally blame him for this since the syllabus is very dense).  However, he expects the students to understand all material as if we spent days on each topic.  For example, in my 4000 level math class it took us 40 minutes to go over Cantor's proof for the uncountability of real numbers, but somehow Gross showed us the same proof in the last 2 minutes of class.  All I know is that if I didn't previously see a lot of the material taught in this class I would be completely lost.  A lot of the material seen in this class is covered in a lot of the higher level math classes and I find it hard to believe Gross expects the students to understand the material at this level.  Now, onto his tests.  I have never taken a test that is so off topic with the material covered in class.  His tests only test you on your natural grasp of math and minimally tests you on the information covered in class.  I learned after the 2 midterms that I could have studied for another 30 more hours and not have received a higer grade.  For example, his problems seem at first glance a straight forward easy problem.  However, there usually involves one tricky step that has nothing to do with discrete math (it usually has to do with \"seeing\" a shortcut or something like that).  Each question is similar to that: you either see the trick or you don't.  If you don't see it, you will probably will not be able to start the problem and receive 0 points on it (and this hurts since the test consists of only 5 or 6 problems).  Overall, (and I really do hate writing negative comments for a professor) I would say run as fast as you can from this class.  If you do not need to take this class as a requirement then don't.  I found this out the hard way.",

I don't know why professors are expected to be entertainers these days, but if that's what you care about in getting an education, I think Zeph always succeeds when he tries to be funny. He is as funny as his jokes so either you laugh with him or at him. Teaching-wise he's quite good; he's clear and he makes good lecture notes. The notes contain most materials but not some worked examples, and the materials are easier to understand when lectured to you than when you read them, so I definitely recommend going to class. Exams are generally tough, requiring thorough understanding and rewarding little for rote memorization. So do try to learn the concepts and don't use memorize the techniques. But if you have a solid math background (probably if you plan to do the CS theory track), the course should be easy for you. Others don't need to worry too much because the curve is quite generous. A note of caution: as with Computability as another poster mentioned, the first half of the course in general is much easier than the second half, possibly because the first half covers concepts you have more likely to have picked up in math classes. Also, things like probability seem to be very difficult for some people and very natural and easy for others. Flip through the book in the beginning of the course to get a general idea of the topics, then gauge your math aptitude/experience to budget your time.",

About the exams, he says that they are intentionally difficult to have a wider distribution: \"I'd rather have a range of A's from the 70s and above so that I can distinguish between the very good students and the exceptional ones.\" The truth is that if you've got \"it,\" he is an enjoyable professor.

This is a required class for a lot of people, and it's gonna suck for a lot of people, but I DO NOT RECCOMEND TAKING THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR CHEN. He seems nice enough, but his teaching style and class structure is a mess. Try a different professor.\n\nClasses consist of the professor writing notes on a chalkboard and trying to explain concepts. The notes are borderline unreadable if you don't sit in the first few rows. I often found myself having to take a picture of the board with my phone and zoom in just to read it. The recordings frequently had problems such as missing audio, a completely zoomed out camera, or bizarre camera angles that make it impossible to read the board. Oftentimes if you missed the notes in class, tough luck, there's no way to look back at them. The professor has an accent that may take some getting used to, but the main issue is just the confusing and dry way he explains topics. Despite attending every lecture, I learned a lot more from YouTube than class. I recommend the channel \"Easy Theory\".\n\nThe organization of topics is reasonable, but the organization of the class is a hot mess. Along with the problematic recordings, questions on Piazza (our Q&A board) were frequently left unanswered. The professor also doesn't use Courseworks for anything, instead opting to use his own website. While I didn't experience this personally, there are many posts on Piazza of people complaining that TAs ghosted them (just didn't show up during scheduled office hours). If you actually manage to attend an office hour, TAs often give confusing, conflicting information that sometimes even needs to be clarified with Piazza posts or emails hours or days later saying \"actually ignore what I told you in that office hour\". When I went to office hours, I found it far more useful to discuss the homework with fellow students instead of trying to get answers out of the TA. There are occasional review sessions held by TAs, some of which were fairly helpful. However, links to the recordings of these review sessions were often missing, broken, or hidden in the reply of a reply of a Piazza post.",

The grading breakdown is  as follows:\n20% homework (best four out of five)\n40% midterm\n40% final\n\nHomework is due roughly every 2 weeks and usually consists of around 5 problems and are graded out of 50 points. They usually require you to write some proofs. I frequently struggled with them and needed to attend office hours, research the concepts, and spend hours upon hours on the assignment. There is a textbook that can provide some help. Homework is submitted through Gradescope and is graded pretty slowly (several weeks). They do give partial credit and I generally found grading to be pretty fair. Late submission are not accepted.\n\nThe midterm and final are both only 1 hour and 15 minutes long and consist of 5 questions. This is a good amount of time, and most of the questions seemed fair. HOWEVER, on both the midterm and final, the first question consists of several true/false sub-questions, each of which are worth a RIDICULOUS amount of points. On the midterm, each one was worth 6 points (the whole exam is worth 100 points), and since there obviously isn't partial credit for true/false questions, just messing up on a few of these can absolutely tank your grade.\n\nI think getting a passing grade in this class is reasonably achievable, but this class will also probably suck your soul out and make you hate this topic."

Although I was very confused initially, during some units, I managed to catch up by reading the textbook, lecture notes, and rewatching lectures. I also found her lecture notes to be incredibly clear- to be honest, you'll probably be fine just reading the notes. Yes, the proofs are a little tiresome at first, but as we progressed in the course, I thought the proofs started to get more creative and I got the hang of it more.

The previous reviewer seems to have an issue because Robert mainly teaches at a small college (he sounds elitist to me). LOL great researchers does not mean great teachers. Robert is actually one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. He posts lectures beforehand to accommodate those in different timezones (since at that time in 2020 recordings took 24 hours to be posted instead of right away like now in 2021), and also to allow students have a head start on the HW since the summer schedule is condensed. He's available during office hours and the TAs were great. He even accommodated students during the exams for those in different time zones. His grading was generous, AND his teaching was great. He definitely does NOT just read off the notes. The notes are literally him minimizing the students' work: instead of having students take notes during class, he provides enough notes that lets you just focus on the lecture, and then use the notes to study for the exams or a guide for the hw. He also fixed the typos of the notes and re-uploaded them :/ Like really the previous reviewer just comes off as an elitist and everything he said was wrong. His lectures were sufficient enough that I did not have to resort to the textbook or any other online resource, which says a lot, and I am by no means a math genius. \nTake him.",

Another issue that I found out in the second half of the term is that I was getting too caught up in the fine details of what was being taught in the lecture and wasn't really getting a full picture. But taking a step back from the material to see the larger picture, especially during the Turing Machine section, helped immensely. \nEven though I struggled with just about everything in the course, I would recommend taking it with Tal because she is super intelligent and is really helpful and approachable in office hours. I only went to her office hours towards the end of the class because I thought she would be somewhat intimidating but this was not the case at all. Some, myself included, found her intimidating in class because she would sometimes answer student's questions with \"I'm not sure where your getting confused\" which can be awkward for the student asking the question but Tal doesn't mean it with an ill intention. So, if you can get over this bit you should be fine or go to her OH and ask in a smaller setting. \nI'm not sure how this course will be structured when we go back to campus but the format was three unit tests worth 30%, 30%, 10% of your final grade. I got somewhat below average on all of them - nothing by more than 5% less than average - but did fine on the homework (except for one where I got 50! lol) and the quizzes and ended up with a B+ so the curve is really generous. For context, the averages for the tests in fall 2020 were around 70% each time and I genuinely thought I had failed the second test which was worth 30% yike. \nWith all that being said, I do think that the homework grading can be inconsistent and sometimes (rare for me at least though) just doesn't make sense. Grading is not always inconsistent, but it certainly feels shitty when something unfortunate like that happens to you. But, as long as you go to office hours when confused you should be able to get some helpful pointers about where to start - some TAs are more helpful than others so best to figure that out in the beginning of the term. \nThis class was one of those courses where I disliked it during the course but reflecting on it, it wasn't so bad. That is a strong argument for not taking the course though...\nTLDR: The curve will save you even if you feel like you are failing.",

I thought the homeworks in particular were very well thought out \u2013 5 problems, only 5 homeworks per semester and he drops the lowest grade. They neatly covered the concepts and they weren't easy, but they weren't too hard. With some help from office hours, I learned a lot from completing the homeworks, and got good grades on all of them. Aho's office hours are quite good, but the TAs helped a lot as well.\r\n\r\nThat being said, unfortunately I did feel like I learned a lot more from the homeworks than I did from the class. Aho is not a very engaging lecturer \u2013 he talks very slowly in a monotone voice. He also fails to go over very many examples for a lot of the theorems, because they are common sense to him (he is a very Smart Man). I do, however, believe that you can learn to learn from Aho \u2013 at the beginning of the semester I felt lost at every lecture, but towards the middle and end I realized that if I attended class and wrote down everything he said, then went over it later for ~30 minutes with the online lecture notes, I could definitely understand the material.\r\n\r\nNote: apparently Aho is also the only one who teaches lambda calculus (other than Verma, who is new). Although the subject itself is easy, it is also useless plus it means the rest of the semester is rushed so that he can fit in lambda calculus.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would say it is a good course taught by a good professor. However, it seems that the other sections have been taught by amazing professors (Yannakakis, Verma, etc.), so make sure you look at your options but don't feel bad if you get stuck with this one.",

I'm sure there are other people who feel differently, but this was my experience:\r\n\r\nLectures- Aho seems to think that the material is a lot easier than it actually is, often failing to adequately explain simpler concepts in favor of complex proofs, etc. that never appeared on homeworks or exams. This is probably due to the fact that he pretty much invented a lot of it; however, for most of us, this was our first experience with theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nAho also just plainly isn't an engaging lecturer. Listening to him lecture is a lot like listening to your great-uncle drone on about the Great Buckwheat Shortage of '68 (if your great-uncle is a great storyteller, then ignore this). Occasionally, Aho will talk about having dinner with Stephen Wolfram or working with Kernighan and Ritchie at Bell Labs, which is always cool but doesn't necessarily make the class worth taking.\r\n\r\nHomeworks- hard, but doable. There were five problems per problem set. They were problems that you had to do out and solve, which turned out to be useless because:\r\n\r\nExams- both the midterm and final were 10 true/false questions (with brief explanation). I just don't understand how ten true/false questions can adequately assess your knowledge of CS Theory. For the midterm, I studied all the algorithms and the workings of automata, but I did poorly on the exam (far below average). Many of the T/F questions were tricky (average was a 45, std. dev. of 22).\r\n\r\nFor the final, I didn't bother to learn how to solve any problems or do any proofs, because I knew they weren't going to be on the exam. Didn't really know much about Turing Machines. Bad mindset, I know, but I just studied the general concepts and did much better than the class average (which was a 75).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion- my recommendation? Take this class with someone else. I was not impressed...I'm not trying to be disrespectful towards Aho, but he is a professor that should be known for his accomplishments, not his teaching ability. Apparently he got a Great Teacher Award from Columbia at some point, but I feel like that has a lot to do with his legacy.

There was nothing exceptional about it, but the fact that there was nothing strikingly wrong with it puts it well ahead of most other CS classes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken. \r\n\r\nThe professor wrote excellent lecture notes which he posted online, and followed them closely during lectures.  He also handled questions from the class very well, and it was clear that no question ever came close to phasing him.  His progression through the material was both organized and logical.  If I had any criticism, it would be that we went rather slowly through details of proofs and constructions that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem very fundamental to the course, and we could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone through a bit more material if some of this was streamlined.  \r\n\r\nThe assignments for the course were very reasonable in scope and they did a good job enforcing the important points for each topic.  It seemed that he actually chose the problems based on what he covered in lecture and thought was important.  They were assigned and due every 2 weeks, and each consisted of four problems of varying difficulty.  Solutions to these were posted after they were handed in, and graded problem sets were returned a week after completion.\r\n\r\nThe exam were also pretty fair.  Some problems were more difficult than others, but nothing too ridiculous.  Both exams were during the 75 minute class period, so the scope of the problems was not very large.  The median on the midterm was 73 and the median on the final was 63.  ",

It's just the presentation of the material by Yannakakis and the textbook (HMU) that is lacking.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is no doubt a brilliant man, but he's a mediocre teacher. He puts up slides of lecture notes on Courseworks and teaches directly off of them in class. This led to maybe 30 out of 87 students actually attending the class.\r\n\r\nThe textbook often has convoluted proofs and too few examples. It's the defacto textbook for automate theory, but I think it could be improved. Sipser is another book which has slightly better explanations.\r\n\r\nYannakakis teaches concepts in a reasonable manner given the dense material. Most people didn't attend class and just studied from the slides and textbook. His explanations are not much better than the textbook and you can learn everything from his slides.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to make sure you are up to speed with what's being covered in class. The material can be dense and hard to follow, so try not to get lost because it will lead to a disaster when exams come around.\r\n\r\nProblem sets (40% of grade) generally have 1 or 2 easy questions and the rest are hard. It is advisable to check your work with classmates since homework counts for 40% of your grade and you shouldn't lose too many points on it.\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much if you don't completely understand some complicated proofs (eg- NFA to Regex, PDA to CFG conversions). If you know the method that it proves, you'll be fine for exams. He never asked to prove something in an exam. Questions were along the lines of design a DFA, CFG, Turing machine, algorithm, do a reduction, etc. Some of them can be tricky.\r\n\r\nThe midterm (30%) and final (30%) consisted of 6 and 5 questions respectively and were both in class. They were manageable, but kind of hard since we got so little practice solving problems. The course is mostly theory with few examples and 4 problems per homework don't really prepare you for the tests. Make sure to study all the lecture slides and problem sets for exams. Read the textbook whenever you get confused by the lecture slides.\r\n\r\nGrading is fair. TAs grade both problem sets and exams. Final letter grades were also very reasonable.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't avoid Yannakakis, but neither would I recommend taking this class if someone better (like Aho or Malkin) were teaching it the next semester.",

The book is light on theory and heavy on examples, and you could probably get away with not going to class for the first 10 weeks or so until Turing Machine reductions start to be explained, because the book's explanations until then are always thorough enough. Lecture clarifies and sometimes expands a bit on the book, but not in any fundamental way, e.g. there might be a slower and a faster way to implement a given algorithm, and the book gives the slower one while Yannakakis will show the faster one in class. Once you get into Turing Machines, going to lecture is pretty important. The book sucks on reductions.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer Yannakakis isn't exciting (it didn't help that this semester's room was poorly lit and had amphitheater style seating -- quite conducive to dozing off) but he is usually quite effective at going through examples clearly. He's been doing this for long enough to know which points people get confused about, and he makes sure to hammer those home. The only times I was truly lost in class were on a handful of particularly weird proofs that he demonstrated purely to make a point; they never came up on homework or exams.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is (as those of you who've Googled him will know), a pretty big name in the field with a prize or two to his name. There aren't many opportunities in CS Theory for him to show off his brilliance, but he is clearly in total command of the material in a way that not all professors always are. He virtually never makes mistakes on the blackboard (he's usually working from his lecture slides, which are excellent and available on CourseWorks), and will occasionally respond to a seemingly narrow question by tying it to much broader questions and answering those, too.",

Over the course of the semester Choi grew a lot as a teacher (it was his first semester teaching!) and gave us his own examples, clear explanations, and answered questions happily. He also seemed to realize that telling students to leave was NOT a good idea, and encouraged us to send him emails and raise our hands in class.

The material itself is very dense, extremely theoretical, and requires some familiarity with proofs based mathematics. Basically, no amount of coding skills will help you in this class, as it is essentially an advanced math class.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks and midterms are challenging, often requiring insights that are all the more difficult to achieve because Choi's \"explanations\" often you more confused than before the lecture. Be prepared to spend hours staring at a problem trying simply to decipher the meaning of the question. It is absolutely maddening, and yet, there's no better feeling than figuring out one of those tricky questions. The midterms have many true/false with justification questions with no partial credit, which Choi posts on his exams as T/F/J. I wish I had gone for the pure Justify, without ever definitely answering true or false - I would have done better, as the questions seemed to deliberately be exploiting flaws in common intuition and expectations. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this class was a slow, torturous slog through material that had the potential to be interesting, though I don't know if I would go so far as to compare it to the horrors faced by the unfortunate pineapple in the review below. Choi is an uninspired, robotic lecturer who always feels most comfortable reading from the book. There is no reason for anyone to be surprised at this, though, the man basically said as much when he himself advised us to skip lecture on the first day. However, to his credit, he did start to be more responsive to the class's questions and more active in giving us study materials after the entire class performed dismally on a final that he apparently expected to be easy. I think he became more comfortable lecturing as the semester went on, and while I don't think anyone would ever use words like \"interesting\" to describe those last weeks, they were at least tolerable.

                "content": "I am currently taking Comp Sci Theory with Choi, and I would definitely recommend him.  At first the class was boring, because he taught straight out of the book. By the first midterm, I only came half the time, because it wasn't interesting. Before the midterm, he did an informal survey evaluation to see what the class thought. I was in his office hours before the midterm (like most professors, his office hours are useful if you have specific questions). As we were packing up to leave, he said that the evaluations had been really bad, and he had to figure out how to change the class.\r\nAt this point, you might be wondering why on earth you would take this class. Here's the thing: he really listened to the evaluations! I came back to the first class after the midterm, and he had totally changed the way he taught. Instead of going through every proof step-by-step straight out of the book, he focused on the main concepts of the proof. He engaged in a dialogue with the class, asking how we would approach a certain question, and breaking it into manageable chunks. For example, he might start by asking what approach we should take (proof by contradiction, diagonal method, etc). It's amazing what a change there's been in the class.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, if you want a completely formal, rigorous proof of every theorem, you can read the book. (I should mention that the book he uses is very good-- thorough, readable, with useful diagrams.) What Choi's been teaching us is far more valuable-- how to think about a proof, how to go about setting it up. In other words, his class is great for building your logical intuition. \r\n\r\nIt's also a fun class, and he makes it seem much more intimate and interactive than you would expect for a hundred-person class (as you would expect, about sixty people show up on any given day). There are twenty or so people who regularly ask questions, and he's learned all their names. It's a comfortable, yet productive atmosphere.\r\n",

Luckily, his class notes (posted on his website) are a very condensed, very readable summary. They don't cover everything, though, so you'll have to fill the rest in yourself.\r\n\r\nAho is a very clear and straightforward lecturer. No matter what question you ask, he's able to answer it without hardly having to stop to think - almost robotic (in a good way). Few mistakes, doesn't skip a beat. And a good sense of humor to boot.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were straightforward - the problems were difficult, but short (either you knew the answer and could justify it, or you couldn't). No need to memorize tons of proof details when studying, as long as you understood the process and the underlying concepts. Be warned, though, there was at least one trick(y) question on each exam, so you really need to know the material well!\r\n\r\nI'm glad I took this class, as it gave me an appreciation for theoretical computer science (particularly lambda calculus) that I never had. It wasn't the most back-breaking CS class I've taken, but it's definitely one that you'll want to dedicate some time to, partly because the material is dense and abstract, and partly because Aho is just an all-around awesome dude.",

If, like me, you enjoyed Gross's digressions, you'll probably also enjoy accounts of evenings spent (no joke) playing violin concertos with the author of \"The Art of Computer Programming.\"\r\n\r\nYou, like Aho, should care deeply about the material.

It's not that he isn't brilliant (he is... for heaven sake's he is the \"a\" is \"awk\"), it's just that he has trouble teaching to a class.\r\n\r\nNow for the good: His office hours are golden. I cannot stress this enough. If you go into his office hours not understanding something, you'll come out of it completely and utterly understanding the subject; end of story. He is TERRIFIC 1 on 1. The homeworks are incredibly hard, so I recommend checking in during his office hours to double-check your work (or ask for pointers -- no puns intended) before submitting.\r\n\r\nThe other: As I said, his homeworks are incredibly hard (think Discrete math, but far, far more difficult). One of the last problems he gave us included a proof that HE had made in 1993 or some such proving that the way that perl handled regular expression recognition was NP-complete (when he first proposed this... no one believed him until he proved it). There was no way I could have solved this problem without going to office hours. But moreover, with the possible exception of the aforementioned problem, his assignments, while hard, are pretty fun. I don't mean you'll think they are entertaining, but they are well structured, so they are informative, and if you end up understanding the problem, it really helps you get a comprehensive understanding of the material (which is great). He also gives out practice exams that are incredibly useful. Grading is decently quick and fair.\r\n\r\nThis class is required for CS majors, so you have to take it, but if you have an option of taking it with or without Aho, take it with.",

It is recommended that you form study groups to do the hws and study for exams, it will make the experience less painful. \n\nIf you master the hws, and the readings of the book and think you are ready for the test, you'll be presented with new problems not seen before that will test how much you internalized the knowledge of  the subject . \n\nbe expected to do a lot of studying on your own, of course that if you are a math person, who loves math and cs theory, you'll be find, but if not, then a lot of work from your part will be needed. \n\nI enjoyed the class, is one of those classes that when you finish, you take a lot whole information of the subject with you.\n",

Group discussions on the homeworks are strongly encouraged.\n\nFourth, the tests are slightly easier than the homework problems, but not a lot. The tests do not usually involve lengthy proofs like the homework does, but there are a lot of tricks in the tests that you need to be careful with. \n\nAll in all, a difficult class, but with a VERY BIG curve.

She explained the concepts and went over examples that fell in line with the exam and homework questions. I had the expectations of learning the fundamentals of computer systems, and I would say those expectations were met \u2013 binary information representation, boolean algebra, combinational circuit design, sequential circuit design, finite state machines, memory and addressing, MIPS, processors, and caches.

The weekly reflections involved briefly summarizing key points and insights related to the past week\u2019s content and asking lingering questions. The problem sets were each around 5-7 free-response questions related to the course content and at the time, were graded by completion rather than accuracy to encourage using it as study material while being less punitive (which I really appreciated). The only exceptions were the two MIPS programming homework we also had (separate from the programming assignment).

The exams (one mid-semester and the other on the last class meeting of the semester) felt fairly representative of the course content for the two halves of the class, and the difficulty felt relatively fair, so long as you studied sufficiently (I didn\u2019t). For each of these, I would heavily recommend reviewing the homework questions and possibly finding questions similar to them, as the exams\u2019 questions felt similar to these. Also check over potentially making minor mistakes when taking the actual test, as that was one of the pitfalls I fell into when I took the course back then. For the course\u2019s weighting, it felt relatively balanced considering the content of the work that counted for each portion, though I will say I would have liked it if the programming assignment had less weight. On average, I\u2019d say I spent 10-15 hours per week on the class, leaning towards the heavier end when we were in the MIPS unit."

Moreover, Fundies is an INTRO course which a PhD candidate is more than qualified to teach. Also, Martha Kim is more than qualified to decide who teaches her course!\n\nI think Martha Barker creates a supportive learning environment which I have rarely experienced as a woman in CS. Many of the professors in the core classes create a hostile environment that ultimately discourage students from asking for help when they are confused. Martha is very receptive and equitable of student's needs. I am someone who has struggled with CS and this has been the best class yet (first class I have done better than the median/mean LOL) because of the supportive environment and clear, slow lectures. She does not tolerate when a student speaks over someone else or is rude in general, which is also a huge problem in the CS department. She does not tolerate students interrupting each other/her or generally being rude to students or her. She definitely is nervous, but I think that does not affect the clarity of her instruction and that people are just mad that a young woman is teaching this course. She does not post recordings publicly, but if you ask her before the lecture that day, she will send it to you. It is a personal choice to not show up to lecture and deal with the consequences of that. Her slides are clear and effective but confusing if you do not come to lecture. Might I add that this is a notoriously difficult course regardless of the professor and most of the reviews seem to ignore that. She does anonymous in-class polls to check in with students for their understanding of the content which is also helpful for knowing where you stand in the course content.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you show up to lecture, go to her office hours to ask questions when you are confused, or just to listen, and put in a solid effort before exams, you are almost guaranteed to do well in this course. \n",

I am not paying SO much tuition for a PHD student to teach me a core CS class. Barker simply sucks at teaching. She's clearly nervous and really hesitates when it comes to answering questions, which makes it really hard to take her seriously and pay attention in the course. She rushes through the slides and doesn't write anything out but just highlights everything in such neon colors that makes it even harder to understand her material. The course is already extremely difficult and having a professor that sucks at teaching, makes it extra hard. On top of that, when asking for extra review sessions or help on the ed, the TAs just tell you to come to office hours (even though some people may be busy during them). One time I stayed after to ask her a question, and she was extremely condescending and unhelpful. Her slides and lectures compared to Martha Kim's is 10x worse. She also refuses to share her recordings even though we all know she's recording them. Although I go to class every week, I can't understand everything right then and there because there's a large amount of information so having the recordings would be extremely helpful. Overall, she SUCKS as a teacher and sometimes I don't even know if she knows what she's teaching. ",

I understand Professor Barker is a PhD student, and she is clearly new to teaching. \n\nI would also like to share that in her defense, I do not go to office hours simply because I either work at my part-time job or have classes during those times. Additionally, I do not engage on EdStem as much as I should, so I acknowledge that this may be contributing to my generally negative review. Lastly, please do not conflate her person with her teaching. I am sure she is a great person, but I am not a fan of her teaching at all.\n\nI have had my share of terrible professors, but even then, I have never felt as negatively about a professor's teaching before.\n\nProfessor Barker simply goes too fast during lectures that they are not even worth attending. After attending every single one of her lectures being fully focused (not looking at my phone and whatnot), I have not been finding any virtue in attending lectures and I find them, in short, a waste of time. I am not exaggerating when I say that after almost four weeks, I have only learned about 15% of the material we have covered in class. Within that 15%, about 80% is material I learned from taking discrete last semester.\n\nLectures do not help with homework at all. And even if lectures aren't supposed to help with homework, it is ridiculous to expect students to go to office hours to even figure out how to start a homework problem when we pay to take a class to learn things that should help us figure out the homework. Classes should ideally be self-contained.\n\nI am getting to the point where the midterm is a month away, and I am already studying. I study for the entire day. Nonstop. During the weekend. To try to figure out what is going on. The fact that I am already studying and getting so desperate that I printed out and completed maybe 100 pages of midterms from similar courses at other schools to try to get more practice should say a lot. The fact that I am trying very hard, using methods that are tried and true for me in other engineering courses, but still failing to reconcile the gaps within my knowledge should also say a lot.\n\nThe textbook is also not very useful, not for the purposes of doing the problem sets at least.\n\nI also do not agree with the policies of this course. I understand that the purpose of making students request to have access to the lecture recordings is to encourage attendance, but more than 50% of people in the class already don't attend lectures. Additionally, one of my friends has gotten a lecture recording before, and they say that having the ability to rewind and slow down the recording makes it so much easier to learn things. Lastly, it is beyond me why lecture recordings expire within seven days. There are many people who use lecture recordings to study for an exam, and the fact that we are denied this avenue to \"encourage attendance\" is horrendous.\n\nThe silver lining? Homeworks are graded on completion at least.",

Rubenstein does use massive slide decks (typically >100 slides) to teach the material, but aside from the slight difficulty you may encounter when trying to find a specific concept in the slides after the fact, they let him cover a lot of content in detail at a relatively rapid pace. Personally, I liked the speed at which the course was taught. It's also helpful that Rubenstein tends to spend the first 5 minutes of each lecture reviewing what he covered the class before and everything is recorded. Lectures aren't always the most entertaining, but then again there are only so many ways you can make things like MIPS or adders sound exciting. If you've ever wondered fundamentally how a processor works, you'll definitely find it at least somewhat interesting. \n\nRubenstein himself is a pretty good lecturer. He sprinkles in some solid (though often underappreciated) jokes every class and is very approachable. He also clearly knows his stuff and can answer pretty much any question thrown at him. ",

For us they were open note, but honestly that didn't help much.

Lemme just say... no I'm not doing fine. As a CS major that is not interested in CE or EE, this class is going to be such a headache. The first homework sets will be doable since they deal with binary numbers and K-maps, but after that when you get into MUXs and further, you will struggle a lot on the homeworks. Rubenstein makes the homeworks very challenging, so the only way I'm turning in these PSets is by the help of the TAs explaining and helping me out with them during OH. The midterms and finals are 3 HOURS long and are tough. The curve for the midterm was higher than what I accepted because of the CE majors. Good thing, I didn't take this class seriously or personally and just did the bare minimum. I barely know anything in this class, and I'm cool with that. I'm never gonna use this class as a software engineer in the future. Rubenstein assigns tough problems, but I appreciate his generous grading policy. If you attend 80% of your weekly assigned TA office hours section, you'll be guaranteed at least a C- as a final grade--you don't even have to take the final if you do not want to if you decide you want to accept your C-. This grading policy benefits me as someone who does not really find importance in learning the content in this class in a serious manner. If you're just a CS major trying to get through the CS core and trying to get fundies over with and believe that C's get degrees, I would recommend this class. Aside from that, Rubenstein seems like a nice and cool guy that likes to throw some dad jokes and memes occaisionally. His powerpoints are like 100-200 slides on average and he SPEEDS through them in lecture, so don't expect to understand any of the content when first going into class--it'll require reading over the slides in your own time to understand.",

So I relied on the TAs a lot! My TA was amazing and he was willing to overlook tiny errors for most of my assignment. He also helped me a lot to figure out how to approach the problems. Honestly, if you are planning on taking this course, when doing the problem sets, figure out how to approach each of the questions. Like what info to look out for in the questions and how to use them and things like that. \nMore about prof would be that she is a nice person but she really doesn't seem to care about how much pressure she puts on the student. Like the quizzes which make up one of the largest parts of your grade, she gave only 20 mins. When we requested more time, she just seemed to turn us down. Not just that, often time it seemed like she dismissed our feedbacks. In fact, she specifically mentioned she wants the time pressure. But she replied to her emails within a week. However, I was often redirected to the TA's instead. \nHowever, I have to admit I liked the class structure now that I am done with the class. The workload was evenly distributed in a way that it was impossible to fall behind on the content unless u give up on the class. Also loved how we went from bits and logic to eventually MIPS how codes actually languages like C and java to bits into MIPS and then binary. Like the progression was PERFECT! really tied everything in. \nWord of caution: DO NOT POST QUESTIONS ON SITES LIKE CHEGG OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. Don't even use it. Lots of students got in trouble for this. Go to TA's instead, or ask a friend. My friends were really helpful.",

Her lecture notes/slides are almost useless for completing her practice sheet questions, and she absolutely will not give you any advice/hints on piazza. Instead, she just shuts you down and sometimes deletes piazza posts out of \"academic integrity\" concerns. It's a bit ridiculous/neurotic honestly. \nThe worst part by far is how she DELIBERATELY adds hard/trick questions to the practice sheets, just to make them harder and bring down the class average. Because her lecture notes are almost unusable for understanding the practice problems, you basically have to meet with your TA and teach yourself the material from the book. Her teaching style is incredibly strange, in that I feel she intentionally leaves out important details in order to \"make room\" for the harder problems. Thus, you have to look up/teach yourself the concepts she deliberately left out in order to complete the practice sheets. Luckily, my TA was incredibly good, and I credit them with actually teaching me the material from this course. \nI have no issues with intentionally adding harder problems into the practice sheets, but it should be done in such a way as to enhance student learning. With Kim, she does it simply to make things more of a challenge, and nothing else. There is literally no other purpose to adding these \"trick question\" type problems that make you spend hours and hours trying to figure them out. This instructor also constantly corrects herself, to the point where I wonder if she actually understands what she's saying.\nI hate to be so negative, she's a nice person and all, but she should really change her approach to teaching. It seems she's VERY worried about her class being \"too easy\". Instead, she should approach teaching with the end goal of enhancing student learning.",

She lectures pretty clearly and has a solid grasp of the material. She was also very nice and had some funny quirks in class! Since we were all taking the course virtually, she decided to split the class into three components: reflections, homework and quizzes. She kept a very consistent schedule with a reflection and homework due every week (with the exception of breaks), and quizzes (administered on CourseWorks) about every 2 weeks. I would say this was a very effective way to spread all of the points in the class out without having any make-or-break exams/projects during a semester that I'm sure has been difficult for everyone involved. Professor Kim and the TAs ran a very well organized and responsive Piazza. I was very appreciative that there are at least some professors that are taking into account that the semester isn't a normal one.\nThat being said, there were some parts of the class that weren't so great. While I think Professor Kim's lectures were clear, they sometimes seemed disconnected from the homework given to us. While the majority of each week's homework was easy to get most of the problems done, it was very hard to get full credit, as there were a good amount of curveballs thrown. They seemed either completely random or too complicated for the level at which the lectures were presented. Many times, at the end of the semester, it was easy to misinterpret the question and approach the problem incorrectly. However, my TA was very helpful and I probably wouldn't have as good of a grade in my class without him. A few (Not many! But a few) quiz questions weren't super clear and could easily lead to getting the question wrong.\nBut, with all that being said, I learned a lot and I would definitely recommend taking Professor Kim's class!

I can tell she's passionate about the material she teaches, but unfortunately, she suffers from glossing over/oversimplifying important concepts and underestimating the importance of specific details in order to properly complete her problem sets (she calls them practice sheets). Her lectures are only useful for understanding the material from a \"big picture\" perspective but are not very good for developing a more refined base of knowledge needed to complete the problem sets. The problem sets often draw upon information/concepts that were only given a few moments of time during a lecture, (if at all), but really needed to be addressed in more depth in order to complete the problem(s). There are frequent oddball type questions that, again, are there simply to make the class/problem set more difficult. To do well, you should meet with your assigned TA as often as possible, and read the book.\nDue to her teaching style, it seems she designed the class to make it harder than it really needs to be, just for the sake of making it hard! This makes getting full credit for the problem sets quite difficult and doing them becomes quite arduous and very frustrating. Learning basically becomes a chore with this instructor.\nShe is also incredibly unaccommodating for specific personal issues you may have encountered/experienced as a result of the pandemic/online only learning, as \"she wants to be fair to the rest of the class\". I found this incredibly strange, as we are in the depths of a global pandemic, but I suppose each instructor is entitled to grant or deny these types of requests based on their own judgemental standards.\nRegardless of her drawbacks, I did enjoy this course, especially the last half when MIPS programming is taught and tied into the concepts of the earlier half. Everything comes together very nicely, and you do get a good idea of how all the individual components/concepts you learned fit into the greater whole of the class.",

We were all pretty confused during the second half as well, which covered computer architecture and assembly language. To his credit, Simha sent out regular surveys for feedback, and did seem to care. However, this does not excuse the fact that the problem sets were totally unlike what we had learned in class (as in going to class wouldn\u2019t even prepare you to answer them, you\u2019d need to read the textbook). Luckily, they were ungraded, and most people I know wouldn\u2019t do them.\r\n\r\nThe logistics of this class were the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and worse than anything I could possibly conceive of myself. Attendance factored into your grade, but since it was a 300 person class, Simha made us hold up signs with our name and UNI on them and then photographed the entire room (309), having the TAs search through the photo to mark us present. There were weekly \u201cstudy groups\u201d (recitations) that were longer than class itself and factored into your attendance grade. These were really awkward, since everyone would sit there and not pay any attention to the poor TA. For the midterm, which was after the semester had been moved to remote instruction, Simha had us film ourselves, record our screen, and submit both for full credit. Yikes! I know he\u2019s a security expert, but that is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, plus students were allowed to use the bathroom.\r\n\r\nSimha is a smart dude.

I seem to be in the minority of people who consider the material interesting. It's basically an overview of low-level software and hardware--we learn about circuits, computer architecture, memory, assembly language, a lot of of physical stuff that most CS majors are happy to ignore. You might not like it just because you don't like the content, which is valid. If you try to think of everything as a puzzle, it might become more interesting to you.\r\n\r\nThere were weekly homework assignments that counted for 10% of your final grade. They were actually quite helpful for understanding class concepts. Since they were very low stakes (graded out of three points) I didn't have to worry too much about getting everything correct. I could just try to put in good effort and ask my TA to explain the rest. I loved the p-credit office hour setup. I felt like I was able to connect with my TA more and learned a lot from him--I was lucky to get a really good TA. I learned a lot in this class because the homework setup encouraged learning instead of punishing mistakes and TAs were very accessible.\r\n\r\nThe exams were kinda meh. I felt like the instructors were not very generous with partial credit or were constrained to strange restrictions, and that's why the STD was so big. Professor Rubenstein provides many resources for studying though (including one past exam that includes pictures of him dancing, what a riot).\r\n\r\nProfessor Rubenstein himself is clearly incredibly smart. I could tell because he would often make up examples on the spot or work through an example he already had without relying on his notes. His improv skills, however, were not quite as high. He sometimes got a little confused or lost in the details, which would in turn confuse the class. He could improve a lot if he would just make sure his live problem solving matched up with any lecture notes he wrote before class! His slides are detailed and beautiful. He's also clearly a bro. He was fun to have as a professor, and I wished he taught another class just so I could take it with him.\r\n\r\nMuch love from pb&jae. Keep lifting!",

She turned out to be a really good lecture, and I ended up taking the course. I thought she did an excellent job in teaching the material. This being said, I owe a good chunk of my A- to my TA, Stanly. He was an amazing TA and gave a week-long (each day 12 hrs) of TA OH during finals week. As for Martha, she was still a very great lecture and I feel conveyed her point. She noticed in Piazza that people still struggled in certain topics, but she went over them again during the review session, which really helped. I recommend you keep track of the review session material because, at least in my semester, she tested on them. All of this being said, even though I loved her as a lecturer, the class was a sh*t show after the midterm. It got entirely overly complex and I couldn't understand what was going on. I had a near-perfect score in the midterm, so that is telling you something. I asked around, and people were lost as well. Before the midterm, she would spend a lecture or majority of a lecture on simpler stuff, but after the midterm would spent the exact same amount of time on very complex diagrams such as processors. I found the processors stuff very difficult. My recommendation is to read the book regarding those sections (MIPS, Processors) before class. The book did a great job in explaining them, wayyyyy better than she did. Because of this, I went from scoring near perfect on the midterm to terrified of getting a C or worse in the final, but the TA, Stanly, did a week-long OH during finals week where he offered OH from 8 am to 8 pm. He was a legend and I owe my A- to him. I went from barely understanding anything post-midterm to being confident with one day of his help. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to make sure you understand the practice exams by heart. I found most of the P-set problems hard so didn't bother to do them, some did, they said it helped. Up to you if you want to do them. I recommend you also go to the weekly recitation session because it is both an easy 30% grade for the class and also because it is a great way to ask questions on anything you are lost in. ",

                "content": "Writing this as an update since the course has apparently changed a lot since the last reviews. Basically, now there are 8 problem sets but they aren't turned in or graded, and your grade is based entirely on your midterm, final, and attendance to optional recitation sections. Because of the optional problem sets, I mostly blew off this class. I did virtually no work besides a day or two before the exams, and just crammed then. I missed class a decent amount (especially after the midterm) whenever I had a lot of other work. When I did go, I was not very focused and didn't take notes.\r\n\r\nIn general, though, the class was fine. It was relatively easy and I got a fine grade despite blowing it off. The material is interesting at times, but often it felt like we weren't going into enough depth to really learn much. Lectures were decent but often I felt like Prof Kim would touch on many topics briefly (for example, different kinds of circuit components beyond the basic ones) without going in-depth, so it felt like she was lecturing on things that we didn't really have to know. Since we wouldn't go that deep into topics, I often found the problems she gave in problem sets were either very easy or were too difficult to really understand based only on what she taught in class.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the course covered basic circuit stuff, with combinational and sequential circuits building up to Mealy and Moore machines. The second half covered MIPS and then 3 sample MIPS microarchitectures that show how a processor actually works. \r\n\r\nThere were 8 recitation sections, and they felt pretty much useless. The sections are meant to go over questions from each week's problem set, but mine met the day after the problem sets were released so literally no one had done them. I would guess that even on other days, most people didn't do the problem sets. You could probably get more out of the recitation sections if you kept up with the problem sets and asked questions, but I basically went and zoned out for an hour. The TA wasn't great either, he had a decent command of the material but sometimes couldn't answer questions, and he had taken the course with a different professor who emphasized different parts of the material.\r\n\r\nRecitation attendance is optional, but helps your grade. If you attend all 8 recitations, your grade is 30% recitation attendance (which is effectively 100) and 70% from your exam grades. If instead you attend 4/8, you get 15% of your grade from recitation, and 85% would be based on your exams. This is pretty nice, but the actual grades are just based on a curve of the raw grades, and most people attend most of the recitations (mean attended was like 6.5), so the actual affect on the grades is probably kind of modest. I think the curve was pretty nice, probably like median B+. I did pretty well on the midterm exam and basically average on the final and got a decent grade, so can't complain since I put very little effort into the course.\r\n\r\nOverall, it sounds like the course is much easier than it used to be. You can get by with minimal effort, though you won't really get that much out of the course.",

                "content": "This class is a real mixed-bag. On the one hand, the course does a wonderful job of bridging the gap between understanding simple circuitry to how programs run on a processor \"under-the-hood\". On the other hand, the course structure and execution can be a bit daunting (and frustrating) for many students.\r\n\r\nCovering the material *completely* is nearly impossible. Moreover, teaching it in a way that reinforces *understanding* rather than *memorizing* is really quite a challenge. To accomplish this, Prof. Rubenstein has taken the tactic of presenting quite abstract (and hypothetical) problems for homework and test questions. I have a feeling that this is the crux of why a lot of students struggle in this class.\r\n\r\nGetting good at answering his \"type\" of questions is definitely a skill in-and-of itself. They typically require a combination of brute reading comprehension (to understand what the problem is asking), parallel thinking (to see the \"trick\" of the solution), and deep understanding of the concepts in order to identify the critical step in the solution. Once you understand the trick, the solution typically follows from the general concepts (rather than a concrete list of steps).n Again -- I have a feeling that this is why many students feel lost -- because this type of parallel thinking is hard to teach. It comes naturally to some students, and is quite difficult for others.\r\n\r\nThis method is great for confirming understanding, but really, *really* punishes students who need extra time to wrap their head around the problem before tackling it. The tests are laid out such that if you don't \"get\" the problem quickly, it can really set you back. This can be quite troubling to students, as the grading scheme is basically entirely built around performing quickly and accurately under pressure on the tests. (In contract, the rest of the grade is based on TA-office hour attendance, and homework completion -- both of which, most students max out on).\r\n\r\nI really like Prof. Rubenstein as a person -- he's fun, and personable, and has a great (albeit somewhat whimsical) sense of humor. As a professor, he's a bit on the scatterbrained side. It's obvious he understands the material, but the way he walks through it in class fluctuates between spending way too much time on repetitive concepts, or not quite getting to the critical point on more in-depth concepts. Either way, communicating the subject matter in an effective way is quite a tall order, so I tend to cut him some slack. I really dislike the grading scheme, but I'm not sure I could come up with something more fair/appropriate. \r\n\r\nOn a more specific note, Prof Rubenstein has a habit of coming up with completely outlandish analogies to explain concepts. Unfortunately, I more often found myself using my understanding of computers to decipher the analogy rather than using the analogy to further my understanding of computing. To provide an analogy to illustrate this teaching style, it would be as if I was ordering dinner, and I didn't know whether I wanted the steak or the chicken or the pork, so the chef went ahead and cooked all three, then just started putting them in front of me until I either saw something I liked or just nodded and asked \"why are you giving me food? this is a computing class!\" -- but instead of a chef making food, it's Prof. Rubenstein making analogies, and at this point the whole metaphor breaks down, because I really didn't think it through entirely before i started typing... and if you're even more confused by this, then you now understand what some of the analogies feel like. (As an aside, his washing machine analogy was spot-on. high-five, dude)\r\n\r\nAnyways, I digress. If I made any mistakes in this review, I'll fix it in the slides on piazza.",

That type of material was glossed over and lectures on that made me intimidated, although also a little enlightened by what was available. Like Stephen Edwards' PLT slides (and perhaps because these slides were borrowed from Edwards), the slides were mostly show-and-not-tell. In other words, little reasoning was included in the slides. Mostly, I had to either be very alert and think as fast as I could during class to understand what was going on the slides, or accept the fact that there weren't exams anyway so we didn't have to understand things but think about how I might need to know those concepts to do the projects.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more productive for us to learn approaches to building circuits, rather than only show us extremely advanced examples. The examples gone through during class were intimidating and misleading in their complexity and tediousness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although Kim started out as a terrific lecturer, this class ended up crushing dreams and was a terrible decision.

I looked at earlier reviews, thinking the course wouldn't be too heavy. I was completely blind-sided by the workload. The standout positive aspect of the course were the TAs which were all absolutely fantastic and much more helpful than everything else, slides, lectures, and textbook. I spent about 2x the average time at TA hours in this course, as it was practically mandatory to complete some of the assignments. I NEEDED to attend OH to get anything above 0. I wasn't the only one with this approach as there were regularly 30 people there, clogging up that small TA room, and resulting in a 2 hour wait to talk to a TA for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nLike others have said, projects 1-4 were okay. After project 4 I thought surely this is the toughest it can get, omg how wrong that was. Project 5 and 6 went off the rails with difficulty. Maybe not for a hardware engineering major, but for CS students seeing this stuff for the first time, yikes. It's also important to note the TA's reactions to the different projects, most were excellent from projects 1-4 and it seemed almost elementary to them. This broke down a little on 5 and 6, I could tell some of them were less confident in the material. Not to mention one project was given to the TAs same time as students!!\r\n\r\nThe problem sets completely dominated my semester. I could do nothing else while one wasn't completed. To add insult to injury, putting 30+ hours into an assignment can still result in a 0 regardless of how close you are to a working solution. The prompts are purposely vague and requirements could be boiled down into one sentence, which meant going to office hours just to understand what was required. The assignments are generally all frustrating, often operating on a single crux. If you got it, the rest was easy and you'd get a top score, if you didn't get it, chances are you got a 0.\r\n\r\nTA grading was black and white, except for some edge cases. If you miss something small and obvious that has no bearing on your understanding of the material, nor the focus of the particular assignment, you're getting a zero.\r\n\r\nAll of this wouldn't matter if the material was super useful for your career, but for the majority of CS majors who will be doing software development, this course doesn't return much in practical skills. The MIPS programming is an exception to this and is by far the most valuable thing you will learn.",

I won't overgeneralize and state that such was the case for everyone, but I do know that a lot of my peers who were also enrolled in the course had a hard time.\r\nIf you're considering taking this class, please note that she changed the organization of the course entirely starting last fall (Fall 2016), getting rid of exams and giving grades only based on the projects that were given out throughout the semester (6 for Fall 2017, 4 for Fall 2016).\r\n\r\nJust to share a few things about my experience:\r\n- I wouldn't say she's a bad lecturer, but she's not a great lecturer either (as some of the older posts suggest).\r\n\r\n- Lectures were less and less helpful as the course progresses, which is bad since the projects get much harder, especially for the last two.\r\n\r\n- How you perform on the projects do not reflect your level of understanding about the material. You can still end up with bad scores and ultimately a bad grade even if you have a solid understanding about the theoretical concepts, due to lack of experience in circuit implementations.\r\n\r\n- Too much focus on performance and optimization for the latter projects. Functionality does not guarantee full credit; you can still end up with a 0 even if your design works. Sure, I understand performance is important in circuit design and that there should be a means to distinguish those who have put in the work and have performed better than others, but considering that this is an \"intro\" computer architecture class and that most people are using logisim (the circuit simulation program we used in the course) for the first time, I think the grading scheme was too harsh. Doing well in optimization tasks requires a lot of experience, and it wasn't like she provided enough guidance or knowledge for people to cover that up. It was very, very frustrating. \r\n\r\n- Nobody even knows how she calculated the grades in the end. To a question on Piazza asking about the curve and the final grade distribution, she answered: \"I set and do not publish cutoffs as those are my judgement calls and not something that is up for debate/discussion.\"",

Email reply time takes a long time and the administration of the class is poor. The TA review sessions sometimes strayed with TAs solving problems incorrectly. On top of that, the curve is very harsh now; it seems like average was a B- based on my conversations with others who took the class. Style points (+10 to prettiest solutions) skew the curve on efficiency based assignments (since the highest possible grade was in the 60s-70s for both of them but the +10 style points made it as if it was in the 80s). Like before the curve is basically determined by those last two efficiency-based assignments (out of 6) which means consistently good performers got meh or even bad grades for doing average on two assignments out of six.\r\n\r\nOverall, it seems like Kim isn\u2019t taking feedback from students year to year.

                "content": "This course has changed from previous years, apparently. I have never seen students put in so much work for a class and get such little return on their investment in terms of grades. This class does not account for effort in any shape or form. The tests she designs to test your circuit are at best surface level and the TAs don't even glance at your circuit to see how hard you tried. Obviously I'm not a circuit engineer but I can see merit in awarding students points for at least building the underlying functionality associated with the prompt even if it doesn't pass the most ridiculous handshake tests. \r\n\r\nThere were 6 projects in Fall 2017, with the first 4 being doable and the last 2 extremely difficult. Mental health goes out the window because the last project was due in the middle of reading week, and takes up to 40 hours for the average student with testing, OH, and talking to other students. Because there were 6 projects, they didn't have a lot of spacing between them, especially towards the end of the semester. There isn't a lot of space given if you slip up--there's like 3 late days for the entire semester and only 2 can be used per project. \r\n\r\nAlso there's very little point going to class, the material is in no way related to your understanding of the prompts. If you want to learn about the field and what a processor looks like etc, then go. She was a pleasant lecturer, and answered questions in class. Before the due date of every assignment, she would do a 5 minute quick review of the prompt which was helpful sometimes. \r\n\r\nHope this course changes/becomes a little more of a modern discussion and application based class. Best of luck to others!",

                "content": "If you're looking for the manifestation of the worst qualities in a college course ever, look no further. Fundamentals with Martha is by far the worst CS class, and by extension the worst class I've ever taken in my life. The class is 100% project based, and let me tell you, they're brutal. This semester there were 6 projects, projects 1-4 being fairly easy (averages were high 80s-low 90s), and projects 5-6 impossible. The projects are designed in a way so that you either get a 0 or a 100. (actually, more like 0 or 80-90, and then you climb your way up to 100 by making optimizations). This means that if the project takes 20 hours to complete, even if you spend 18 hours on it, you'll get a 0. So your final grade is pretty much based on projects 5-6.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about projects 5 and 6. They are ridiculously hard, to the extent that some of my friends actually cried doing them. Not only that, the project is \"out of\" 100, but even Martha can only score a 67 on project 5 and 73 on project 6. Why would a professor have you do a project that she can't even score a perfect score on? And these scores are calculated directly into your grade, meaning you're considered \"doing well\" if you get a D (67). If you used up your late days (you get 3), every day after that is a 15 point deduction, regardless of the project. This means that handing this project in late by a day leaves you with a 52 - basically an F. Like what the hell.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for this class were virtually useless. Office hours were always crowded, with 2 hour long lines just for 5-10 minutes with the TA because everyone had issues of their own. Most of the time even the TAs would have no idea what was going on yet people still went to them because no one else in the class had any idea what was going on. Martha always seemed annoyed in her office hours as well, very reluctant to help out students stressed out by her own concoctions.\r\n\r\nThe cherry on top is that you don't learn a single thing from taking this course/attending lecture. Most people who take an introductory systems class at any college knows what an ALU is. I can safely bet that 90% of our class didn't even know what it stands for. The class being purely homework based, people started not showing up mid semester. She also makes careless mistakes during class which was a huge turnoff. You know it's a poorly designed course if you can theoretically do project 6 on the first day of class and going to lecture for an entire semester likely had no impact on your performance overall. All you have to do is learn how Logisim (software for designing circuits, which by the way, is not even in development anymore) works and just do every project.\r\n\r\nLastly, this class made me hate computer science. My logistical complaints with the course aside, if a professor who teaches a CS core class makes you hate a subject you like, the professor shouldn't teach that class. This class singlehandedly ruined my semester.\r\n\r\nPro tip: avoid Martha Kim at all costs. Based on the final grades, pretty sure she curved to a B-.",

                "content": "tldr: this class was nothing like the previous reviews. the lectures are useless for the projects. the projects are insanely hard for no good reason. martha kim was not caring like some previous reviews mentioned but seemed to gain pleasure from giving people 0s on projects. the curve is bad. she might change, since this semester seemed like an outlier, but i personally had the worst educational experience in my academic career so far and i would not recommend this class to anyone.\r\n\r\nhere is a list of things that i felt was wrong with this class:\r\n1. first four of the six projects all have super high average (around 90). if you mess up on any small thing, even something she did not mention in the prompt, there is a high chance that you will get a very low score, including 0. for instance, in one project she first gave some people 0 out of 100 for not having the correct reset behavior but otherwise perfect circuits. she did not mention anything about the reset behavior in the prompt, and so later gave these people 80. there are many other examples where people turned in the circuit thinking they have a functional design, but because of her failure to fully describe the specifications, ended up being surprised by poor scores.\r\n\r\n2. there are so many specifications you need to meet. if you fail to meet any one of them, you get a 0 regardless how else you have demonstrated what you learned in this class. while some might argue this is how things are done in the \u201creal world\u201d, but i think for a class where each project weighs about 1/6 of the entire course grade, giving out 0 out of 100 so easily is seriously wrong.\r\n\r\n3. the later 2 projects are supposed to separate people, so it\u2019s about how well you can optimize. here\u2019s a quick fact: about 1/3 of the class got 0 out of a 100 on project 5. the averages and medians are really low for both of these two projects. i spent five days straight working exclusively on this project, and ended up being right above the average. i never worked so hard on any school project ever. i know at least four other friends who worked even harder and received poor grades. it\u2019s really not about how hard you work.\r\n\r\n4. project 6 was due on the THURSDAY OF READINGS WEEK, just a week after project 5 was due. because these two projects were so hard and took so much of my time, i was not as prepared for the finals as i should have been. i\u2019m not sure if that was even allowed, but it was a real pain in the ass when you are trying to study for other finals but had to be stuck with two hardest fundies projects of the semester.\r\n\r\n5. sure there are people in this class who are very passionate about the material and spend a lot of time on the projects. but based on the experiences of most people i know in this class, they are taking this class only because its in the CS core. most people will never touch these stuff again and absolutely do not have interest in the low-level stuff. this class definitely failed in both properly introducing people to the field and giving people a general idea of how things work under the hood, given how difficult the projects are. what people learned in class is virtually useless, which defeats the purpose of projects.\r\n\r\n6. the TAs are literally incompetent. i went to many office hours and one time for project 5 the TA told me the completely wrong idea, which is later corrected by another TA (Tom, who seemed to be the only legit one). i feel like most of the time their lack of knowledge and/or poor ability to teach only confused the students even more.\r\n\r\n7. Martha Kim is nothing like what the previous reviews said. she did not postpone a project due during midterm week, which is fair i guess. but scheduling projects 5 and 6 so close to each other and one in readings week was a huge fuck up. students really suouldn\u2019t be penalized for her own poor ability to schedule things properly. in addition, like i said the numerous specifications make you think that she loves giving out 0s to people and see them suffer, as demonstrated by ~60 zeros for project 5.\r\n\r\n8. curve??? i got basically perfect on the first four projects and 50ish on the later two, which are all above average, and i got a B?? based on my experience with the CS classes, i was expecting an A or A-...\r\n\r\nthis class was a total nightmare, and i just hope that i will never touch anything lower than C and see Matha Kim again.\r\n\r\n",

When students pointed out to her that a large CS Theory assignment and a large AP lab were both due on the same day as one of her assignments, she agreed to push her deadline back a few days and give us the weekend to work on it, which was pretty cool.\r\n\r\nThat being said, she really screwed up the grading for our semester. The first two projects were too easy, with median grades around 95, and the last project was too hard, with a median grade around 40. The curve depended mostly on the third project -- in other words, our performance in the class was more or less determined by one assignment. To some extent, she admitted that she made mistakes and was trying out the project-based assessment scheme for the first time, and she curved the class generously to compensate. I don't think she'll let that kind of thing happen again.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for the class were pretty bad. More often than not, it seemed like they didn't know what was going on.

They had to spend half the time you met with them just figuring out what he was asking. The averages in this class were extremely low. Yes, averages are often low in comp sci courses, but in this class it wasn't simply because of the difficulty. It was because no one understood the material because he can't teach!!!! After the midterm grades came back he came in front of the class and said that we shouldn't complain about the average being so low because we're columbia students and tests are supposed to be hard at Columbia. He constantly tells you not to worry about grades because they don't matter, which is just annoying. I learned more from a 10 minute youtube video than from 75 minutes in his class. I would go into more detail about the class, but he's not worth my time. I wasn't smart enough to listen to the reviews. Save yourself. Don't take this class or any other class with Professor Rubenstein.",

I'm aware that Rubenstein is not teaching fundamentals next semester, but I don't care, because the world needs to know how fucking terrible he was for fundamentals, so that hopefully nobody will have to go through it if he ever teaches it again.\r\n\r\nTHE LECTURES:\r\n\r\nProf. Rubenstein reads from his slides. Word-for-word. The lectures are aggressively boring, to the point where Rubenstein himself would get bored\u2013\u2013at which point he would tell a bizarre and completely unrelated story (\"So this one time I had a 6AM flight, and I was staying at the airport, so I told my friend I could wake up at 5:45 and make the flight, and then I actually did it, just to see if I could, but I forgot that security still takes like two hours even if you're sleeping in the airport, so I ended up missing that flight. Anyway\")\u2013\u2013and then get back to some of the most amazingly uninspiring lecturing I have ever witnessed. I can't believe I consistently went to this class. It's a waste of time.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMEWORKS:\r\n\r\nAlways tedious, and the questions are often extremely unclear. Unfortunately, the homeworks are only tangentially related to the slides/the classes, so 80 percent of the work you'll be doing on these homeworks is figuring out what he actually wants you to do. There were 8 graded homeworks this semester\u2013\u2013there were supposed to be 9, but somehow, even though we do literally nothing in class, Rubenstein fell behind, so that there was a 9th ungraded one (but it was still fair game for the final!)\r\n\r\nTHE TESTS:\r\n\r\nAs annoying as the homeworks are, the tests are a worse version of the homeworks. Completely unrelated to the tasks you do for the HW and the slides, these tests are difficult, confusing, and don't really reflect your understanding of the material. Every question introduces a new concept, so that you will be scrambling to read through his (often error-riddled) questions until you figure out the game for that particular question.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN HIMSELF:\r\n\r\nThe thing is that I actually kind of like Rubenstein\u2013\u2013he can be funny and he's kind of a goofball. But he is just a truly bad teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, for your own sake, don't take fundamentals with him.",

Talking to the TAs makes a big difference because many are knowledgeable and good at explaining stuff.

He spent the first lecture telling us how last year's culpa reviews were all wrong, and at first I thought it was going to be okay but then...\r\n\r\nOkay, okay. So he's not the worst. It could always be worse. I survived the class and learned some cool stuff. And yeah, he's a nice guy and a great person. But when every sample final exam that he gives us has at least one mistake in it, and when he doesn't even know the answers to his own homework problems... It makes me pretty worried.\r\n\r\nI actually don't think that he was that bad of a lecturer and I didn't really mind that the slides had some typos (though I'd maybe recommend not scribbling all over the whole slide in red... I heard someone got him a stylus but I don't think that helped much). He was decently helpful during office hours too, and he does seem to really care about us learning.\r\n\r\nThe main problems were the homeworks and exams. As a previous reveiwer mentioned, homeworks were posted late and graded late and sometimes tedious, but that wasn't even the worst part. Towards the end, some of his homeworks would ask questions to which he didn't even realise the answer, until a student pointed something out to him in office hours. He then tried to say that it was still an answer too but, c'mon, when the question asks \"How can you minimize stalling?\", \"you actually can't\" shouldn't be the answer.\r\n\r\nOur own midterm had a few very significant typos in it (he gave an example of how his state machine worked and his example contradicted the instructions) and our final had a few errors too. Luckily, he grades on a pretty good curve. I didn't think I was doing amazing but I ended up with an A.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you're stuck taking this class with Rubenstein, it's okay, just keep up with the material, go to office hours if you need to, and find some friends in the class to cry with when you can't handle it. And hope that he's a bit more organized next year. If you have a choice though, I'd recommend trying Kim.",

You would expect a professor who has taught this class several times in the past to know his material by now and have error-free slides. While some of these mistakes were corrected, there are still plenty of typos in his lecture slides, so be aware of that when studying from them. Also, logistics are poorly organized with HWs being posted late and taking forever to be graded.\r\n\r\nStarting with basic logic gates, the course slowly builds up towards creating a CPU. You learn about the underlying hardware behind a simple computer and how the programs you write actually work. The material in the first half of the class can be a bit boring, but you see how everything comes together when discussing the MIPS architecture, which is pretty cool. I was bored because of the slow start (I took Intro to EE and CS Theory before Fundamentals, so the first month was just a rehash of things I already knew). Hence, I never participated or really cared about was going on. Rubenstein would also give students points for discovering errors in his slides, and I felt like it detracted from the class because it \"gamifies\" education. Sometimes I would notice mistakes in the slides and not bring them to his attention because I didn't want to partake in his silly point system. Also, the homeworks were super tedious and didn't teach you much. They aren't representative of the harder yet more thought-provoking questions he asks on his exams.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was hard. It was longer than the practice tests, and it was nearly impossible to finish within the allotted time. It also had a couple of typos. His exams are open book, but it doesn't really help much because the questions he asks on exams generally require you to extend circuitry covered in class and solve problems creatively. He has good intentions for his exams. They are designed to make students think by asking non-trivial and interesting problems, but they're poorly executed because of the often long and winding questions or just because Prof. Rubenstein didn't think the solution through enough leading to a different answer than what he expected. Partly because of my attitude towards class and because of the difficulty of the test, I did pretty badly on the midterm.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the class, I made an active effort to pay attention. I found the course much more enjoyable (may have been because the material became more interesting) and Prof. Rubenstein a much better teacher. He's pretty helpful in Office Hours, so please go to them if you get stuck. The final was better than the midterm because I actually cared about the material and also because of the extra time we had. In the end, what you get out of this class depends on how much effort you put into it. Rubenstein's not the most inspiring teacher, so unless you take the effort to ask him good questions, classes can be pretty boring. You have to push him to take an interest in teaching you.\r\n\r\nI think, overall, it might be better to take Fundamentals with Martha Kim for now. Rubenstein's not bad, but there's a lot he can do to improve Fundamentals. (He also reads CULPA reviews, so I hope he makes the class better in the future).",

However, in looking at her previous reviews and comparing it with my experience with her this semester, it appears that she has improved a good amount. My guess is that if she keeps refining her teaching skill, she can eventually teach at that level.\r\n\r\nOne thing that others have not mentioned is that you will be programming in MIPS Assembly Language for one of the psets. My suggestion would be to take AP (3157) before or at the same time as this course (I did the latter) since AP really gets you thinking in terms of lower level computing, which makes the assignment much easier.

(Her slide sets are like finely aged wine.)\r\n\r\nShe gives eminently reasonable problem sets and tests (1 midterm, 1 final, noncumulative) and once got off an airplane to fix a glitch in her website that students needed to access for a problem set.\r\n\r\nShe also had a great sense of style, is genuinely and adorably amused by things like slow processors, and will explain things for you in multiple different ways until you get it. She's on par with Adam Cannon and Jae in CS-prof god(/dess) status. If you get her for fundamentals, be elated.",

                "content": "Martha Kim is fantastic for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1) She is a VERY clear lecturer; she teaches directly from slides that on their own are very descriptive, and goes through them at a pace that is easy to follow. She is extremely eloquent and obviously very knowledgeable about the subject material, so it's really easy to follow and engage with what she's saying; she's not one of those awful lecturers who you have to really actively try to pay attention to for the whole class. She intentionally goes over slides with diagrams a little longer than other slides so that students who like to take notes have time to copy them down. There was one day when she had to rush through how Karnaugh maps worked, and in the next class she apologized for the lack of clarity and spent probably the first third of that class re-explaining them and really making sure everyone understood what was going on. If you go to class (and are at all awake/paying any amount of attention to her) you will understand the material. Point of the story: her lecture style is succinct and easy to follow and if you pay attention in class she will teach you the material.\r\n\r\n2) It seems like she really genuinely wants everyone to succeed. She holds more office hours than any other compsci professor I've had and every time I've gone she is really approachable and has seemed genuinely concerned about making sure I am not confused about anything (not to mention she's just super nice). She assigns a very reasonable amount of work because she doesn't want the class to be a source of unnecessary anxiety for students. That being said, the assignments are challenging enough that they definitely do make you learn the material to do them (which I think is a good thing). This is not an easy A class. You will have to do work. But she actually wants you to do well at it, which is definitely not true for every professor at Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe only bad thing I have to say about the class is that the problem set grading has been a little haphazard - on the first assignment, the grading was really harsh, which a lot of students made a big fuss about; then on the next assignment, the grading seemed really easy. But this discrepancy in grading tolerance seems to stem from the TAs more than Martha Kim. \r\n\r\nOverall, she is very intelligent and also very nice and I think she's been a fantastic instructor for Fundamentals!",

                "content": "These recent reviews are not entirely accurate. \r\n\r\nI took the course this semester, and received an A-. I was likely boosted from a B+. That happened because I attended office hours each week for assistance on understanding and completing the homework. Contrary to others' claims, I learned more in the class by having the opportunity to effectively discuss the questions and solutions to the HW with great TA's and with the professor. If you showed up with relative knowledge of the material, the professor or TA's would literally give you the answer if you couldn't reach it yourself. They sought to totally set you up for success. If you didn't take advantage of that assistance, that is your fault and I don't feel bad for you. \r\n\r\nThe criticism I have for this class amounts to concerns about interest by the professor. I don't believe Professor Rubenstein is teaching material he prefers to teach or learn. This results in a class that is less enjoyable, and is unfortunate at Columbia. His course would be 10X better if he enjoyed what he taught, and showed that. That being said, he showed he cares for his students' performance and puts in his stated time to assisting students. \r\n\r\nI wish I had purchased the book. I think the summaries he provided were at times challenging to understand. I also wish the course had a bit more of a clear connection and purpose between the first half of the semester and second, but we always have concerns. \r\n\r\nThe perspective is this - We can read, understand, draw, and design circuits that do cool shit. And if you can't, you screwed up in class and I don't feel bad for you. And you also probably cheated off someone else's homework so fuck you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In any case take, everything with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\nNow there are a factors here that contributed to this that are beyond Rubenstein's control and are my fault, such as the fact that I don't really have a background in computer science, I never went to his office hours (I did attend the TA's occasionally), and I'm a second semester senior.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Rubenstein's style is that of the prototypical SEAS professor. There's a certain level of irony to this, because in his lectures he comes across as personable guy, he speaks English quite well, and he has a great sense of humor, none of which are very typical for engineering professors I suppose. However, none of that means shit if you spend all your lectures expressionlessly reading off slides, do not provide a good text book and assign cryptic error-riddled homeworks expecting people to be able to solve them purely based on what you wrote on those self-same slides. These slides, as the previous reviewer pointed out are also often riddled with errors. Moreover, they are quite repetitive and there are only a few that are truly important in every lecture, whereas the rest seemed like useless filler. Then there are topics that show up that aren't covered very well in the slides on both homeworks and tests. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I'm pretty sick of this en vogue teaching style where professors don't have to do anything except for recite from slides. It's not conducive to learning, and yet somehow the super-genius professors of SEAS still haven't figured out why people don't attend their classes. Or more likely they have, they just don't give a shit, since giving a shit about their students is not high on their priority list. This obviously wasn't the first class where this has happened, and I sincerely doubt it will be the last. The true tragedy here is that Rubenstein seemed well enough aware, occasionally stopping in the middle of his lectures to ask the class if they understood what he just said, and when less than half the class raised their hand, he would proceed to explain the exact same concept all over again in the exact same way.  This created the illusion of concern, while truly accomplishing nothing at all. \r\n\r\nAgain, it may be harsh or nigh impossible for me to claim he didn't care when I never went to his office hours; however, generally speaking, his lecturing style came off as lazy and unconcerned, which puts him squarely in the \"average\" range for SEAS professors. As far as attending office hours goes, he said that if we could show him we knew what we were talking about in office hours it could only help our grade. Unfortunately his lectures were often so devoid of content, I actually didn't learn very much, so I truly didn't know what I was talking about and probably deserved the C. \r\n\r\nSo I guess you should take him if you want a lecturer with an interesting personality and sense of humor and have a pretty good background in this stuff.

His lecture style is very straightforward: he is one of the most rational and simplistic presenters of complex material I have ever encountered.  If I had to take PLT, I would do so with Edwards.  He introduces LogiSim, which Rubenstein does not.  I told several of Rubenstein's students about LogiSim and it made their lives much easier.\r\n\r\nBut really I'm writing this review because of Edwards' personality and humor.\r\n\r\nEdwards is a geek's geek.  Perhaps he doesn't look like one, but he dresses like one and behaves like one.  I find this enjoyable in a professor, but for some it may be an acquired taste, like Scotch whiskey.\r\n\r\nSome co-engineers of mine have pointed out that he can be rude, surly, and dismissive.  I think these attributes seem to present themselves because he is rational above all else, and has a limited amount of time.  (~2 orders of magnitude below Temple Grandin. Let's say the average engineer is about 4 below, Vallancourt is 6 below, and the average art history major is 10 below.)\r\n\r\nI don't think he has ever been rude to me, but in the sense of being hyper-analytical without regard to feelings, Edwards has a tendency to do this.  And I personally find it liberating, assuming I am capable of keeping my ego out of the equation.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say he equates human interactions to a set of logic gates, but in dealing with assignments and career advice, don't expect a lot of small talk or beating-about-the-bush.  Professor Edwards is one of the most direct human beings I have ever encountered.\r\n\r\nIf you need to prove to yourself that he has a soft/creative/dynamic side, keep in mind the following:\r\n\r\n * He modeled for McDonald's in Taiwan\r\n * He bought a vintage PacMan arcade machine and drove it to his office from AC\r\n * He makes bad jokes that pertain to driving even though no one drives in New York\r\n * He wears a fanny pack when he bicycles to and from Mudd\r\n\r\nI may not be the most adept engineer in SEAS, but I thoroughly appreciate Edwards' awkward and dryly amusing brand of brilliant.\r\n",

They consist of him reading off of his overly complicated slides and often not coming up for air.\r\n* He does not require a textbook but suggests two textbooks. His slides are basically reproductions of the books. I had the textbooks and did not think that the slides were enough to understand the material by. I think it's unfortunate that he uses two books when the course could be summed up in one book. He should drop the awful Mano and Kime book.\r\n* His homeworks are a mixture of totally tedious repetitive nonsense (adding binary numbers excessively) which teach little, to extremely esoteric circuit creations which also do little to explore your understanding of the material. Perhaps the course is meant to test your ability in solving puzzles through building circuits - if that is the goal then I guess I've misunderstood the intention of this course.\r\n* His homework policy is to allow for cheating. He allows people to collaborate on the assignments which in my opinion discourages anyone from doing their own work. For those that do their own work and do not compare answers before submission are just out of luck I guess. If you submit without comparing your answers and knowing you have 100% going in, I guess your'e a dope. If the whole class is allowed to collaborate why even give credit for the assignment?\r\n* His exams are insanely unfair in my opinion. After having done reasonably well on the homework assignments I felt unprepared for the midterm/final. There are some reasonable questions but then there are those that will boggle the mind how they accurately test my understanding and knowledge of the material. But again maybe I've failed to understand the goal of this course. His exams consisted of reading a mountain of text to explain the premise of creating some new fangled circuitry. Then having questions part b through d rely on your successful understanding and completion of part a. It doesn't help that in this mountain of text it is mostly incoherent explanation of what he is trying to express. My impression is that they were overly complicated and/or error filled.\r\n* I have had some minor experience with this course's topic before and usually find it fascinating but I found myself unwilling to participate towards the end.\r\n* The course covers too much ground and not enough of it carefully. There seems to be a theme that a lot of what we are learning is not necessary to know. That's insane to me. Everything we learn should be at least interesting and inform our future. Cut out the small extraneous that have no relevance.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n* He is a nice guy and office hours are very useful.\r\n* When he would work out a problem manually on the board this was a very useful exercise. Often I think he would realize the absurdity of certain questions when it would take him 20-30 minutes to complete.\r\n* He reads feedback and there was an adjustment to the pace of the class which at first was going a mile a minute for no reason.",

Lecture notes were riddled with errors, as were homeworks and homework solutions. Lectures themselves were very hard to pay attention to due to the multitude of conflicting information conveyed to us (Prof. Rubenstein had to correct himself and the slides during pretty much every lecture). He wrote on the board for maybe two classes, and those were probably the classes that I actually learned the most. \r\n\r\nHomeworks are very repetitive and students often dreaded doing them because the questions were updated with corrected versions; we still only had one week to do them, so more often then not, I chose to start later in the week waiting for all the corrections to come out. \r\n\r\nAlso he is very terrible at answering emails (I put 3827 in the subject line of all of my emails!). Sometimes questions to homeworks would be answered after the homeworks were due. \r\n\r\nHe has very strict extension policies. A couple of my friends just got 0s on their homeworks because they were sick/absent/had religious reasons for missing the deadline.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't feel like Prof. Rubenstein's teaching was effective, at least for me. But during the times I went to office hours, he was helpful. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in general, he gives no shits about his students. \r\n\r\nHe also said he reads CULPA reviews so I guess this is my honest opinion.

The first half covers digital design and the second covers computer architecture involving learning elementary programming in MIPS assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Good: \r\nMartha Kim is friendly, approachable and helpful. She willingly answers questions in class and for the most part she answers them well - especially when it comes to the computer architecture, she knows her stuff well. She teaches from slides, and what's in the slides is pretty much what you're going to be expected to know for the class. The slides are easy to read and understand and have intuitive diagrams. A lot of the pictures are taken from the textbook. I found the course material interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\nWhat was wanting:\r\nThe lectures were mostly very boring. She spent a lot of time explaining trivial things that we could have understood better and more quickly by glancing over the slides on our own time. Most of the lecture was spent in teaching relatively straightforward concepts but almost no time was spent teaching us to apply them. In other words we did almost no real problems-solving or \"thinking\" in class. Any examples covered, were for the most part trivial ones. As a result, there was a gap between the lectures and homeworks and an even bigger one between the lectures and the exams. The lectures certainly prepared us very poorly for the midterm on which the mean was a 52 and which was so long that almost no one actually finished.\r\n\r\n6 homeworks in the semester, one assigned every two weeks, about 4 questions per homework. Given that we had two weeks between hwks, it was really very little work. I spent an average of 4-5 hours on each assignment, only about 2 of the questions out of 4 actually required thinking, although these ones could be tricky. The problem was that we didn't have enough of these questions and didn't have enough homeworks so when the midterm rolled around, we got killed.\r\n\r\nThe final was non-cumulative and included everything from after the midterm. It was about the same length as the midterm but we had double the time so it was manageable. The mean was 63 - I got a 92. I recommend reading the slides and textbook very carefully. You need to have a complete understanding of the single-cycle and pipelined processors - especially the pipelined one and also get some practice coding in assembly.\r\n\r\n",

And if for some reason a concept doesn't stick, she drops your lowest grade. I would definitely recommend Prof. Kim optimistically to anyone who has to take fundamentals.

                "content": "This is the first review I've ever written on culpa, but I have to say prof Rubenstein is the best professor I've ever had. I was initially hesitant to take this course because I was scared of the course material(circuits! circuits! and more circuits!), but professor Rubenstein presents does an amazing job of explaining things and his lectures are actually enjoyable. I, too, was somewhat worried after reading the old reviews, but now that I've taken a course with him, I know for a fact that those are not an accurate description of him. (Maybe his evil twin brother as someone suggested...) If you need to/want to take Fundamentals, by all means, take it with him.\r\n\r\nHe makes great lecture slides(that are actually better than the textbooks) and post them on the courseworks ahead of time. Some students just read over the lecture notes and do not attend the lectures, but I suggest not to do it because 1. the lecture notes are quite condense and hard to understand without the aid of lectures (at least for me)  and 2. it's one of the few classes where lectures are golden. His lectures are very interactive and he makes it obvious that he's enthusiastic about teaching (which can only help the students). Although the pacing can be somewhat fast at times, if a student asks a question, he'll slow down and explain to make sure the student understands the material. \r\n\r\nThere's about one homework per each week (9 HW total). Homeworks are reasonable, but can be tough. It depends on how much background knowledge you have (If you're good at circuits, you'll breeze through the first half of the course). Start at least 3 days before it's due and go to the office hr if you're having a hard time. His tests are open book/open note, but since he asks design questions, you have to have a solid understanding of the material. There's no surprise questions and he won't try to trick you, but will test you how much you understand the core of the material. Take HW problems seriously, as they will help you tremendously. \r\n\r\nOffice hrs literally saved me. This is the only course I attended office hrs on the regular basis. You come in with a question, and you will walk out with a full understanding of the material. If you have a schedule conflict with regular office hr, don't hesitate to email him and make an appointment. He truly cares about his students, and he'll make time for you. In fact, I never went to his regular office hr as I had another class during the time, but I never had a problem getting help whenever I needed. I got the questions that would take me 10 hrs to understand answered in 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nHe's approachable, funny, enthusiastic, and truly cares about the students. \r\nTake this course with him if you can, and you won't regret it. Interesting course material taught by a great instructor, what more to ask?\r\n\r\n",

                "content": "Overall, I think Daniel Rubenstein was an excellent professor. Specifically, the majority of his lectures were extraordinarily clear. He had well prepared slides for every class, often with plenty of well-chosen images from the textbooks, and spent most of the class time describing what was happening in the pictures. One of his greatest strengths was being able to clearly and succinctly describe and give insight into the functioning of a circuit or architecture. He was also unusually receptive to questions during class. By and large, the students asked thoughtful and helpful questions, and as a result, he was able to clarify almost all subtleties and potential pitfalls in the material. The lectures seemed all the more engaging and participatory as a result as well.\r\n\r\nAll this praise aside, I can how see professor Rubenstein may not be a good fit for every student. Specifically, to get the most out of this course, it is best to take a very active approach. I agree with a previous reviewer that \"it's best to ask a lot of questions and make sure to make it your responsibility to clarify all the material that is taught.\" As I mentioned above, one of the reasons that the professor was able to make the material so clear was that students asked questions whenever something was less than one hundred percent clear.\r\n\r\nAs for the course as a whole, it felt like a gradually unfolding adventure/mystery story. We took a thoroughly bottom-up approach, and starting from the absolute basics of binary logic, gradually added new layers of abstraction until we had essentially designed a computer out of nothing. I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see how all the ideas we looked at unfolded and built on each other to eventually construct such an amazing machine. Some of the ideas we covered, such as latches and flip-flops, are so utterly brilliant that I think it is somewhat of a shame that we never considered the engineers and inventors who were responsible for them. More generally, I think the ideas we covered in the class could have put into a richer historical context.",

The workload was relatively light, but the problems themselves could have been more interesting overall. A lot of the homework time was spent either doing tedious computations (multiplying numbers in floating point comes to mind), or delving into an annoying level of detail, such as describing what effect a small design change would have on dozens of instructions which were not all listed in the same place. He seemed to save the best questions for the two exams, both of which were fun as well as fair."

                "content": "It would appear that Prof. Rubenstein's evil twin taught this class last semester. Don't worry -- the real Dan is back. His slides are gorgeous, his lectures are unfailingly clear, and he's eager to help out outside of class.\r\n\r\nApparently he's used to teaching by drawing everything on the blackboard, but he had rotator cuff surgery early in the semester and had to do everything via PowerPoint to avoid damaging the muscles. Surprisingly, I think this turned out to be a good thing. Once you get into some of the scarier-looking circuitry, I imagine that it's easy to make make mistakes drawing, and I'm certain that it takes forever. This way, we got straight to (relatively) error-free drawings and spent time talking about the big picture instead of worrying about which wires cross.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of those rare classes where the material is interesting without being difficult. Five or six people in the class got perfect scores on the midterm, and I suspect a similar number aced the final. I don't think it's that Rubenstein makes the tests too easy -- this is just really straightforward stuff.\r\n\r\nThe few complaints I have are relatively minor. I think he was still a little sensitive about the last time he taught this course (with reviews like those, who wouldn't be?) and made a point of stopping to make sure everybody was following. This was nice, but the endless refrain of \"are you with me? Raise your hand if you understand\" got a little irritating by the end of the semester. He also seemed to get a little bit confused by some of his own notes about pipelined architectures, but everything worked out in the end.\r\n\r\nIn short, don't be scared off by any review written before 2009. This is a good class with a good instructor, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Prof. Rubenstein for Fundamentals.\r\n\r\nA side note:\r\nThe class nominally requires two textbooks. You can get by without buying either, but your life will be a little easier if you get Patterson and Hennesy. Don't bother with Mano and Kime -- it's almost completely useless.",

So, use office hours, study from the books often, and make sure you get everything clarified.\r\n\r\nAlso, he is very poor on expressing himself. On the final exam, one problem had a mistake in it because it was worded too awkwardly and ended up contradicting itself. This ended up being a big problem because we couldn't do much of the problem until the question was clarified. I ended up kinda guessing what he meant to ask. Also, the really bad part was that this was 1 out of 5 problems, and the next 2 problems built up on the one that had the error.

                "content": "I had heard that Ferguson's class was easy in the past due to take home exams, so I chose to take Databases with him as opposed to the other database professors. It turns out, this class was extremely difficult. Not in the sense that AP is difficult because there's a lot of tricky content, but rather due to how disorganized the class was run logistically. The class feels like getting a ton of fragmented content thrown at you each week, and your job is to figure out how to make sense of it all and organize it into something that makes sense. It's like if you have 1000 necklaces tangled together and you have to untangle them all. This is frustrating because it takes your focus away from actually learning about database systems and makes you waste your time on organizing lecture content. Professor gets upset at how low the lecture attendance rate is on zoom and in-person combined, which is valid. At the same time, the low attendance reflects the sentiment shared by a lot of students in the class that the lectures are incoherent and thus unhelpful. We learn more about the content if we spent lecture time teaching ourselves instead of watching the lecture. Having finished the core of the cs major and multiple cs electives too, I can confidently say this is the worst CS class I've taken. A schedule of assignments is posted on the first week of class, but we deviated from the schedule starting with assignment 1. It's really tough to plan your workload ahead of time, because it's common that the assignments are announced by surprise. Deadlines for the homework are often pushed back if many students ask for extensions, but this results in unpredictable deadlines for future assignments. Professor had said that we will get at least 2 weeks of time to complete each assignment, but due to all the extensions, we only had 1 week to complete the last homework assignment, which was released during the last week of class (aka when many finals are scheduled on the last day of class, and when we also had to study for this class' final exam). I had heard previously that the only downside to this class was the Professor is a little bit disorganized. I had thought, how bad could that possibly be? I can handle a bit of disorganization. If you're thinking that too, I implore you to take databases with any other professor. This level of disorganization results in unimaginable, unnecessary difficulty for students. To put my review into context, I received an A in the class. Yet I am tempted to audit databases by another professor next semester to better learn the content.",

Unfortunately, Professor Ferguson\u2019s style (both teaching and otherwise) just doesn\u2019t work for me.\n\nFirst, his teaching style: I realized during the very first lecture that I\u2019d benefit more from watching them online. But even watching his 2.5-hour-long lectures on 2x wasn't very productive, so I settled for just reading the lecture slides and textbook. But even that was quickly replaced by just skimming through them. I could get by with just skimming the notes because the homework was very easy, and googling whatever concepts you needed was far more efficient. This way of learning helped me do well (enough) in the class, but I honestly don\u2019t feel like I learned what I was supposed to.\n\nNext, the overall course management was extremely stressful and felt inconsiderate. I didn\u2019t know anyone in class, so I intended to rely on Ed for help. But they fostered an environment where asking questions was discouraged. TAs randomly decided which posts to respond to, and most answers were vague or unhelpful. The professor sometimes responded rudely or mocked students for asking dumb questions, which made me very hesitant to post anything myself. He would make big announcements in class and never officially announce them on Ed. And they weren't very accommodating when asked for things like extensions (at least in my case).\n\nI do want to note that Professor Ferguson is a kind person in general. He cancels class when campus is stressful (protests, police presence, etc.) and frequently asks for feedback for certain things and implements it. But I wish he would make bigger changes in how the class is taught. It was very disorganized and stressful, so only take it if you are okay with ambiguous instructions and confusing teaching staff in exchange for an easy 4000-level CS class.",

He also does not prepare any of the code that he is writing beforehand, causing him to spend 20 minutes at a time trying to figure out what is wrong with the non-functioning code. The rest of the lectures are PowerPoint shows, and he is prone to rambling. I do not recommend showing up to live lectures; he records them, and watching them at 2x speed and jumping around when you need to is MUCH more efficient.\n\nMy impression of the homework was that it was not planned in advance at all. None of the assignments were graded until halfway into the semester.

Also gets easier given the amount of both practice through homework and in class examples. \n\nHe is very approachable, kind, and genuinely seems to care. It is both his personality and teaching style that literally made be excited to go to class, and even do the homework. He is my far the best professor in the CS department and dare I say all of SEAS.

He does not care about teaching and could care less about his role as a \"professor\" at an elite university.

His office hours are at random times during the day, or VERY early in the morning because he travels often for his actual job. There's literally no way to know when he holds office hours.\n\nThe worst part about this guy is the fact that he has absolutely no patience for students who are trying to learn the material, or who are knew to the field of computer science. He often ridicules people who ask questions, and has a very snarky, sinister, angry attitude.

Do you think your manager at work will give you a step-by-step outline of what to do? If you're at an elite organization that solves tough problems in the world (honestly doesn't that sound nicer than being a coding monkey???) then your manager will say, here is the exciting problem - solve it. Your will need to then reach out to people at your organization, do research online, use your brain. Yes, if you're new at a project and your boss is good, you can reach out to your boss AFTER you exhausted the other avenues. Otherwise, why does your boss need you over someone else if they always need to hand-hold you ever step of the way? Professor Ferguson stands in the middle where he provides helper code, provides recorded \"how-to\" examples to get you started, and is always there to help, whenever you ask. I've actually never seen a professor make himself so available to his students. Your manager probably won't even give you as much time! \nIf you're working on something important and novel after school, often there is no one \"right\" answer. Prof. Ferguson involves some such questions on his homework. Yet, instead of being excited, I saw many students get flustered and not know what to do when they are asked to think for themselves. For example, he asked students to create an ER diagram on some data. Students asked him questions such as \"is there a one-to-many relationship for x and y data?\" That is a coding monkey question! Ferguson pushes students to up-level their thinking to that of a best-in-class engineer. For example, the best engineers out there say, \"based on what we are trying to achieve and what data we have, here is my recommendation on how we organize it.\"\nThere are many other points on why Prof. Ferguson is one of the top professors I've ever taken, but I'll leave you with one more. Many professors tell you to memorize some rule, you memorize it, you answer on the test, and then you forget. Professor Ferguson asks you questions where you end up understanding the why and internalize the why. For example, everyone who has taken a databases class knows the different types of data storage, such as a star schema. However, do you actually know how to take some data that is not pristine, wrangle it into a star schema, and then query it? In what cases would you use a star schema over another layout? What data should actually be on what table? How do you take the data from Third Normal Form to a Star Schema? I bet if you didn't take Ferguson's class then you will need your hand held when you start working as you wouldn't actually know the answers.",

You receive an email titled \u201cCOMS4111 Final. After spending 3 hours figuring out how to install a Python 3 emulator, you finally manage to open the Jupyter Notebook. Question 1 has 27 parts. The instructions have been removed in order to shorten the exam length. You get another email from Ferguson saying he\u2019s holding office hours 3 minutes before his wedding. A single tear rolls down your cheek. \u201cJust like the industry, you whisper.\"\nLet me give you a quick high school style literary analysis of this passage to help those thinking about taking the class understand better. The author uses hyperbole when they write \"2035\" as a reference to how late many of the assignments, grades, etc. are released despite the teaching staff claiming they will be released the next day. The author then goes on to evoke the pain of setup in this class: \"spending 3 hours figuring out how to install a Python 3 emulator,\" as much of your time will be spent fighting with your computer to just get the software you have to use connected and running. The assignments are very long with many parts, and the instructions are very confusing, a point alluded to in the metaphor that the instructions are almost as if they have been \"removed\". As the author illustrates, office hours do happen at random times and you have to be ready to hop on the call at any time of day, and possibly you too will get the chance to hear about his girlfriend. The author then begins to conclude this masterpiece by emphasizing the visceral emotions one feels through the imagery of a teardrop. This effect is compounded by the author's choice to use the second person throughout the passage. Finally, you are left reminded of Ferguson's constant belief that the undefined aspects of the assignments and acceptance of most solutions as long as they work are \"just like in industry\". By using such evocative imagery, the author, dare I say the artist, is able to capture not just arbitrary details, but the human experience of taking Ferguson's class.  \nAll in all, it was a decent but very chaotic and time-consuming class.",

Questions are often answered in one long Piazza thread instead of separate posts, which makes it annoying to search for. The lecturers are pretty boring and often have only 10 minutes of useful content. OH and the informal recitations with the Professor are basically mandatory. \nI also haven't gotten my grade back yet, but according to everyone I've talked to, even the TAs, most people get a grade in the A range... I just don't know if the time I had to sink into the class just to get it all completed (not even well lol) was worth it.",

                "content": "He's a good professor and once you actually get to know him, a nice guy, but the class itself is a total disorganized mess. I can understand how challenging it would be to design an introductory class based on basic database/SQL concepts because, well, it's not all that challenging, to begin with. SQL really isn't a programming language at all and it's very easy to learn. Basic concepts like \"data cleanup\" and writing the correct SQL query to get the data you want are really not all that hard. Basically, he could spend two or three weeks running through a few examples of various SQL queries/terms, show everyone how to set up basic database software, run through a few basic definitions from the textbook, and that would be the entire class. \nBecause he does not want to run the class this way, (not to mention it would be far too short), you're basically stuck having to google your way through the majority of the class to teach yourself the concepts that were given very little, if any, time in a lecture. Going to the various TA office hours becomes mandatory as well. \nThus, much of his lectures are \"filler\" material that hardly pertains to the class assignments/homework at all. You'll often find yourself saying: \"Well, that was nice to know and quite interesting, but how does this relate to the class assignments?\" Well, it doesn't, because again, the basic concepts of this class are not really all that hard and can be explained in a few weeks, so he fills each class with things that are certainly database related, but are not useful at all for doing the homework. Again, from a class design perspective, I can see why he does this, but it makes going to the lectures tedious and incredibly boring. \nThe main problem with this professor is how INCREDIBLY long the assignments take.  You'll spend hours on google and working with the TA's to complete the overly long assignments not only because you'll have to teach yourself how to do them, but also trying to resolve the various technical/error messages that will arise as you do the assignments. I think I spent more time trying to resolve various error messages in MySQL Workbench than I did learning about databases.\nOh, and the midterm was one of the most stressful experiences of my entire life, mainly because of the way he phrases/asks the questions. The way he words the questions are so ambiguous that you'll be on piazza constantly looking for clarification on whether your approach to the question is correct or not. Doing the assignment involves knowing lots of SQL and getting your queries to run right. To make things more frustrating, every question has a subpart, and those subparts have subparts, so the entire exam is VERY long. The entire assignment took me somewhere in the range of 30+ hours and it was a disaster. \nAlso, when do you want clarification on a specific question, you'll find that you get different answers from different people. If you ask Prof. Ferguson, he'll give you one answer, but the head TA will give you a different answer, and another TA will give you a totally different answer, and maybe another TA will tell you something else entirely. Basically, you'll quickly discover that nobody really knows what is going on or has any idea how to resolve the issues you/the large majority of the class are having, so you'll just become even more confused. Making annotations that accompany the answers you give in the assignments is basically mandatory because nobody really knows what is going on.\nI hate to be so negative, as he's a nice guy and all, but by the end of the class, I think he realized just how much of an absolute and total mess this class turned out to be and just gave the large majority of the class an A.

He was also very available: he held in-person or video office hours all the time, especially near homework or exam deadlines. Also, all of his lectures and online OH were videoed and posted to Courseworks.\r\n\r\nI got the impression taking this class that other sections may be more focused on theory than practice - in this section, most of the homework (and lectures) were focused on how to work with databases than learning database theory. We did spend some time on theory, but as little as Professor Ferguson thought he could get away with, which I really liked. Most of the semester was spent learning SQL, but we spent some time on relational algebra, a little bit of time on graph databases toward the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the homeworks were programming projects in python, using pymysql. Time consuming, but certainly doable and taught me a lot. There was sometimes some ambiguity in the project guidelines, which generated a lot of questions on Piazza, but I think the consensus from Professor Ferguson and the TAs was that you could make whatever design decisions you thought were wise, as long as you included your rational in the README. Basically, I thought the assignments and grading were very fair. Later homeworks (and both exams) were turned in in the form of jupyter notebooks, and a lot of the lectures were available for download in that format; it was a bit of a pain to set up at first but absolutely necessary. Components of some homeworks were also to submit complex SQL queries.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ferguson was also just really understanding and adaptable to different circumstances. If you really need an extension, he will almost certainly grant it. Also willing to listen to student feedback in general: when I took the class (fall 2019) Professor Ferguson used a baseball database for an in-class example nearly the entire semester and as the database for several homeworks. I personally didn't mind this, but some students found the specific terminology to be confusing. Professor Ferguson took this into account and said he would not plan to use this database in the same way in future semesters.",

As with all professors he has his pros and cons.\r\n\r\nBiliris is a ball or energy and a personality in the classroom and undeniably cares about his students. He responds to questions on Piazza fairly quickly, made a point to get to know people in the class. He even joked that we could call him if going through a breakup. \r\n\r\nHe is very energetic and enthusiastic about the material and the examples, and he tends to be good at making things quite simple, so the combination is good. He also continually involves students of the classroom. He will ask for suggestions on how to solve something, ask someone else to point out flaws, etc. This keeps the room fairly engaged for a class that is 2.5 hrs long. \r\n\r\nBiliris welcomes student questions in lectures and will always stop to answer a question before moving on. This both a pro and a con. Sometimes I feel like the class got stuck because we would keep harping on an issue that was either not extremely relevant or simply repetitive. However, the good news is that, if you are willing to raise your hand, you will always walk out of class knowing what is going on. Unfortunately, Biliris sometimes either struggles to understand a student question or misinterprets the question. As such, you have to be persistent with rephrasing till he understands the question, at which point he usually does a solid job of answering.\r\n\r\nThe workload is quite light. There are 4 light homework assisgnments, two projects, a midterm and a final. The first project is significantly more in depth than the second, but the time allocated for the projects reflects that. The midterm is exactly the same in structure as the practice midterm, which makes it easy to study for. No practice final is given, and the material was harder and more technical, so make sure to spend time on Query Optimization when studying for the final. \r\n\r\nHis grading tends to be fairly generous in my view, and I think the level of CS ability in this class is lower than most other CS classes, since it is required for OR undergrads and many masters students seemed to come from weak data structures backgrounds (we spent 30 minutes discussing the complexity of a hash table). Overall, assuming you go to class and pay attention, this is a low workload class apart from projects and exams.\r\n\r\n",

Also, he offers homework and project grace late days which, while helpful, were not always allowed to be used on certain homework and project parts, which kind of defeats the purpose in some way.\r\n\r\nDespite my nitpicking, Gravano is still a great professor!",

We didn't introduce us to any of the numerous databases available (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, ...) and had us play with a variant of an Oracle database that I'm pretty sure NO ONE uses in industry. And now I'm thrown out into the real world with a hammer and I have no idea how to use it.

His jokes are often funny, and he gives a ten minute break in the middle of class, which often extended to fifteen. Having said that, you can manage even without ever going to class, so apart from the few jokes there's very little value addition by his lectures.\r\nThe class material itself is interesting. It c, ould have been presented better (He reuses slides from several years ago, and doesn't even change the semester in the footer), but he has his limitations in teaching ability, and so you just need to make do with it. The four homework assignments are fairly easily. The projects can take time, but if your partner isn't completely lost, you can divide up the work and finish it over the course of a night. The exams are both fair, but of course, there's thinking involved, so it's easy to panic if things aren't going your way.\r\nIf you're not a CS major, I'd recommend to buy the book. His lecture slides are essentially a summary of the book, but there are some concepts that aren't very clearly explained in his slides. If you were sleeping in class (or absent, like I was), the slides will be of very little help in such instances.\r\nI can't say whether Biliris genuinely cares about this class or not, but he definitely gives the impression that he cares about the students.

Read his lectures that he posts online (takes about 30 min) and save yourself the other 2 hours. I can't stress enough how useless his lectures were. It's basically like taking a class online, you just have to show up for the midterm and final. The material is actually extremely useful and somewhat interesting.\r\n\r\nLuckily though, the material is easy and there's not much of it. There's a grand total of 10 short lectures (only 9 of them are tested on), compared to other classes that have about 25 a semester.

The 4 homeworks can be tricky at times, but honestly not too bad.\r\n\r\nThe group projects are relatively easy and straightforward. You just have to demonstrate that your projects contain every concept that was taught in class, regardless of whether or not your Database schema will benefit with it (i.e. Aggregation is great in theory, but NOBODY puts it into practice in their database. it makes things painfully redundant and difficult. but since we learned it in class, you'll lose a substantial amount of points if you don't have aggregation in your database). Don't bother making your project look pretty or have much functionality. As long as you demonstrate the concepts that were in class, you'll get full credit. The median on project 2 was 49/50, if that says anything to you.\r\n\r\nYou have a total of 6 late days, 3 for the individual homeworks, in total, and 3 for the projects, in total.

His lectures were a complete waste of time. He would crap on and on about some simple concept in the most unintelligible way for an hour at a clip. I can honestly say that I did not learn anything substantial from this class. By the sixth week half of the students did not show up or left at the break. By the fourteenth week it was more like 80%. The material was presented with no context and no depth. I could have taught this class better than he did, and I do not have near the amount of database and teaching experience as he does.\r\n\r\n2) I ended up doing all of the group work by myself because my partner was so lost. I cannot blame him considering the lectures were essentially black holes. If I had not had database experience prior to this course I would have probably been as lost as my partner, who had none.\r\n\r\n3) A bit of the material was out of date. This happens in CS classes often, but it was particularly bad in this class. I think the textbook we were using was from 2003.\r\n\r\n4) We were forced to use Oracle for our projects, which was a nightmare. Oracle is one of the most bloated and hard to learn database systems around. Why we would use Oracle and not MySQL (very popular, modern, and easy to use) is beyond me.\r\n\r\n5) Biliris does not understand English well enough to teach a course. He can hold a conversation, but he cannot explain complex ideas. He did not understand questions asked by students and he often hid this by making fun of them.\r\n\r\n6) The grading in this class was ridiculous. Often points were taken off if we did not answer a question exactly how the TAs thought we should have, despite those requirements not being specified in the assignment description. Each homework and test problem was graded by a different TA, which meant you had to contact many TAs if you had questions about more than one problem. This was incredibly inconvenient.\r\n\r\n7) My assigned TA had worse English skill than Biliris, which made him useless to me.",

The second half deals with DB I/O cost analysis, and was difficult enough for Prof. Gravano to turn into - take your pick - Derridean post-modern literary theory or Martian rocket science. Even in the project assignments the most obvious concepts were mangled into research paper theory filler - my project team mate, who sailed through the course, kept wondering why on earth the guy would go to such lenghts to turn the clear and easy into the hermetic and impossible. \n\nAgain, I never had any doubt that Prof. Gravano was putting more than enough effort on the class, considering that as a top scientist on the field he had a busy enough schedule, but the obscurity of his explanations made lectures a tough going, until by the second half he was making jokes about everyone falling asleep. The blank looks he was getting by then contrasted with the sincere interest everyone had on the course material before the midterm, when his challenges and questions started such debates, he had to stop and ask people to quiet down. \n\nThis is one of the few courses in which the difficult textbook proves more useful than the overflowing PP slides or the teacher's talk. The TA I was assigned for the project appeared to get kicks out of taking points for the most trivial mistakes, but then again, it is difficult to blame the teacher for such things - in fact he was the one who had to ask her to take it easy with the grading.

The class is more than a standard db offering in terms of workload: you got to do two projects, a web based db app and another theory-type number cruncher (most db classes make you do that one big app as a term project). There's also homeworks, mostly easy, with an occasional twist. If you go to class, do the projects/homework and score above avg in the exams, you're guaranteed a B+. One caution sign I'd post is: don't ignore the prereqs. You *need* to know how to code, and you *need* to know some data structure stuff. Don't screw around on this one, or you'll run into trouble in the projects. Gravano is basically a good guy. He does his best to help you out (even tho he appears touchy in class when cellphones ring, laptops ping etc, and you got to get used to the self-deprecating humor bit.) He's cool in office hours and email too (he gave several important hints on the second project ... this was a *huge* help after I spent like a whole weekend going blind on the numbers.)

I expected to struggle, but to also learn a lot of interesting material. That sort of came true.\n\nKostis is a very smart guy, and he will try his best to help you out during office hours, but I personally did not benefit from his teaching style. A good proportion of it is not his fault, and I wasn't able to understand him clearly for reasons beyond his control. However, he is relatively new to teaching OS and did not seem too familiar with the content or the homework. We had to rely heavily on the TAs of the class to resolve some of the finer questions, and entirely on the TAs for help on the assignments. Shoutout to them.\n\nI did end up learning a good deal about operating systems, but in a bipolar way. On one hand, the assignments forced us to read line by line through source code on Bootlin. On the other, the lectures were super high level and rarely involved looking at OS code at all. So essentially there was a huge disconnect between the theory and the implementation of operating systems.\n\nThe content of the exams also seemed quite random and seemed to test more on OS trivia rather than kernel code, OS algorithm implementation, or HW knowledge. I don't know how else to describe it other than that some of the questions were \"strange\".\n\nI've heard that Kostis is easier than Jason, and I feel like he will definitely get better as he teaches more, but as the class stands currently, I cannot recommend it.",

                "content": "I have never learned more with such a level of hands-on experience before in my CS education. Most other operating systems classes are almost entirely theory focused and their assignments barely scrape the surface of the essence of OS. In Professor Nieh's class, the six homework assignments work to build a story for your OS understanding. This class is hard, but the value in learning is extremely high. \n\nThere is really no way for anyone to gauge the true difficulty of the class based on reviews. Yes, most of the reviews here say that this is an extremely challenging class, but that materially doesn't really mean much until you are deep into the class. This class is challenging, but with proper warning and preparation, I don't think it is impossible at all. There is SO much help provided for this class, more than I have ever seen for a class. Office Hours everyday of the week (except Saturday) with extremely well-versed TAs, and an Ed Discussion Board where TA's respond within a few hours max. If there are reviewers saying that this class is impossible or that they needed to self-study material, they probably did not utilize office hours.\n\nDon't take this class if you aren't interested in systems programming.\n\nWarnings and Advice: \n1. Take this class seriously. It's three credits, but has a really high workload. I took this in a semester where I only took four classes total and it was still a stretch for me. \n2. You need a good team. You can switch your team every homework, so don't hesitate to do so. This is not the time for being nice. Focus on your learning. I personally switched my team twice and it ended up being okay. They say the limit is three people to a team, but the assignments are doable with two people that have good communication and drive. \n3. Put the ego aside, go to office hours. So many people refuse to go to office hours and waste an unbelievable amount of time trying to get something to work, only to get low grades on the homeworks (me early on). The TA's are extremely helpful, and so are your classmates! OH is a great place to work on homeworks too, since its a pretty collaborative environment. Again, reviewers that say they had to self-teach themselves, probably did not go to office hours.\n4. The homeworks are not one-shot-able. You will need the two weeks. You can \"get things working\" in a few all-nighters if you procrastinate, but you definitely won't get the grade you want in that case. \n5. Exams are pretty difficult to actually study for. The best thing you can do is review homework solutions and try to think about what each part of each homework aimed to fundamentally teach you. \n6. You need to have really clear C fundamentals. You will read significantly more C code than you will write, but in both cases you should be able to read, understand, and write C well. \n7. Lectures are extremely important. It can be difficult to follow tracing kernel code in class, so definitely rewatch lecture. ",

He switched things up about halfway through the semester and seemed to focus more on illustrating concepts on the blackboard, which was a lot more useful.  The exams--not sure what the point of them is.  The median scores are like 30/100, so apparently if you don't answer exactly as they expect you to, you'll be getting a failing grade, even if you did okay on the homework assignments and understood the concepts.  I essentially had to teach myself the concepts using the textbooks and still managed to fail the exams even though I was pretty confident in my understanding of each subject.

                "content": "\u201cLong is the way and hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.\u201d\n\u2015 John Milton, Paradise Lost\n\nOperating Systems I is without a doubt the hardest course I have taken in my life, and will likely be the hardest you've ever taken as well. That being said it is also the greatest course I've ever taken and I would 100% do it again if given the chance. \n\nThe course teaches you (surprise!) how a modern operating system works, using Linux as a case study. You'll read and modify the Linux source code so you walk away not only with an understanding of how an operating system works but how to modify the Linux kernel for your own projects. Now, that sounds cool (and to be honest it is) but this leads us to the fact that the inherent difficultly of the course lies not in the subject matter, but in the sheer volume of material you need to learn in 4 months. If you are considering taking this course, you should be a) be VERY comfortable coding in C (if you did well in AP and understood the material you're good to go) and b) taking a light course load. On the second point, I'm a SEAS student who took 4 classes the semester I took OS, and they were all relatively easy. I still ended up having no free time as I was always either working on the homeworks for OS or the homeworks for my other classes.\n\nThis brings us to the homeworks (Oh God). There are 6 total, and typically you get 2 weeks per assignment (I say typically because towards the end of the semester he gave our class some extensions on the deadlines). Starting with homework 2 you're put into groups of 3. Be sure to choose a good group, but more importantly, if you get a bad partner, SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ONE NEXT ASSIGNMENT. Trust me, you don't want to go through this course alone, look out for yourself. Be prepared for a lot of stress, confusion, and late nights. Once you get to the middle of homework 3 it's not an exaggeration to say you'll be working 30 hours a week on these. Homeworks 1(writing a minishell) and 2 (something with task structs) are easy, homework 3 (process state changes) is the hardest in terms of difficulty (plan to drop this homework), homework 4 (writing a scheduling class) and 5 (something with page tables and memory) are easier than homework 3 conceptually but still have heavy workloads, and homework 6 (file systems) is easy (note this homework will be easy only in comparison to the previous homeworks, this would still be pretty difficult in a normal class).\n\nNow to the lectures. One of the only reasons I think people tolerate the insanity of the course's difficulty is the fact that Jason Nieh is an amazing professor. He's a great lecturer, and by the end of the semester you'll have internalized all of his catchphrases for explaining linux source code (drinking game idea, take a shot every time he says \"under the covers\"). In the inevitable event you don't understand something from the homework, go to his office hours. Not only will you get help on your assignment, you'll get to discuss the homeworks with other people in the class, because everybody shows up to his office hours.\n\nIf you're debating taking OS, the most important thing you need to know is if you love systems programming. And I really mean love, because only love can prompt a perfectly sane individual to dedicate all of their free time and happiness to writing a custom page table that's >1000 LOC only to get a 17/100 because you forgot to build for ARM architecture (unfortunately true story). That's not to say you can't have doubts, but if in the first two weeks you're only moderately interested, drop the class. Like the quote above indicates, OS is the Hell. That's not just my experience, it's like that for everybody. But it's 1000% worth it in the end. You'll make friendships based of shared trauma that will last a lifetime (the friendships and the trauma), you'll get a great understanding of how personal computers actually work, and you'll walk away an incredibly strong programmer. OS is long and hard, but if you stick with it it'll lead you to Heaven.",

My computer froze unpredictably and intermittently. Google didn't help. Stack Overflow didn't help. It just didn't work no matter what we tried. But after that brief 2 weeks in hell, my understanding of the material improved drastically, so much so that Homework 4 did not feel difficult at all and ultimately, our Homework 3 was dropped. Aside from Homework 3, all the other homeworks were challenging but pretty interesting. I definitely felt frustrated while doing them, but never bored. In addition, the homeworks taught me how to use git version control, how to understand a large codebase, and how to collaborate with others, all of which I believe will be helpful later on. \n\nAlso, the exams are very, very, very tough because you have to write code on them.

                "content": "Well, I've always heard other students saying that OS is the hardest CoSci course in Columbia. So, I'm like, well, since I've taken most of my required courses, so why not give OS I a shot? And oh boy, all these rumors about how hard this course is are real...\nThis class is the HARDEST 4000 level course I've ever taken, it's like CLT plus advanced Algo plus complexity theory plus Computer Networks(by Prof Ethan, of course). So yeah, that kind of hard. AP, analysis of Algo I, and lots of other CoSci courses which are labelled as challenging basically becomes...trivial in front of this one. So, please consider carefully before you enrolled this one, or else it will drop a GPA bomb on you.\nSo yeah, do not take it unless:\n1. Your track requires it, well then it's no escape here lmao\n2. You really likes OS\n3. You are a C-language god and knows how to do kernel programming. Well under this case, be my guest, take it:)\nOh btw, even if you have to take OS, if you are a master student, you should take it at the last semester, where you only need to take two courses. This course has a workload of 2.5 courses, so yeah, don't take it when you're enrolling 4!\n\nDon't get me wrong, Prof.Nieh is very good at teaching. He knows how OS(specifically, Linux here) works, and he delivered course contents crystal clear. If you found something vague and unclear, you can easily get your answer by ganking the Prof after class, post an Edstem post or just read the textbook. So conceptually, it was not that bad.\nAlso, the grading process of this course is also very fair. There will be auto testers plus manual review of your submission with clear rubirc. So it's unlikely you got point deducted without a proper reason.\n\nAt this point, you might ask, oh so what make this course so hard? Well, its workload and complexity of HWs.\nThe first one is about writing a simple shell. You just need to make sure it perform just as what the statement defines. Watch for memory leaks! Don't Malloc without freeing things. Valgrind should be very useful here. I mean, you've taken AP before and you better know all of this without me telling you here, or you're just not ready for OS.\nYou should aim for 95+ when doing HW1. Trust me, if you didn't do well or find it too hard for you, you probablty should drop this course. Having a good grade in HW1 will 'pull up' you a little bit in your final grade calculation.\nThe second one should be implementing a system call. It will take a while to compile for the first time. So I suggest you to compile the given skeleton code as soon as it was released. Same rule applies for all following assignments. HW2 is hard, but not hard at all if you compare it with following HWs. Make sure you understand all these Linux and C language conventions, such as Linux List head and all these Macros. They will be very useful:)\nAlso starting from HW2, you will work with a team of 3. You need a WORKING TEAM, which can be either a team without slack teammates or a team with at least one god-tier carry who seems to spoke C language in his/her/their daily life. If you didn't get a good team for HW2, either you can rush it out with your own wisdom(it's still possible for HW2), or you gonna scew up, which is kinda of fine at this point. However, for ANYONE who wants to do well, or at least decent, my rules are:\n1. Get a working team!\n2. Get a working team!\n3. Get a working team!\nYou want to cut steak with a plastic spoon? NO YOU DON'T! I cannot stress more on this. They'd lock me up in an asylum, yet I'd still say, \"GET A WORKING TEAM!\" So yeah, if your HW2 screwed up cause your team does not work, DUMP THEM IMMEDIATELY. Prof.Nieh approves this, you should write an email to him politely, and he will arrannge you a new team. If that does not work. Repeat the dumping process. Don't afraid to be an A-hole in this class, trust me, a non-working team will make you feel much worse then just dumping them. Don't trust your teammates \"Oh I will do better next time\", THEY WON'T and YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THE RISK. Thus, unless you yourself is a god-tier teammate, eject immediately when you feel something is off.\n\nOk, back to HWs. HW3 is likely to be a HW on state of processes, preemptions and threadings. Start early on this one! Or else you might get your first 30/100! Well, at least you can try to figure things out by browsing through linux source codes. \"Source codes are ground truth!\", said by Prof.Nieh. Also, try to arrange your teammates s.t. for any OH during the week, there will be at least one guy in your team be there and querying the TA. TAs are extremely helpful(or else how could we survive through this course?) and you SHOULD ASK THEM QUESTIONS. Your codes does not compile? Ask TAs! You got a Null-pointer-Exception? Ask TAs! You got some unexpected Core-Dump? Ask TAs! Trust me, AT should be a solid rule you follow, just like RTFM. And it's gonna helped you a lot.\n\nAlright, assume you survived through HW3 with a working team, HW4 is about scheduling, and believe it or not, it is not that hard(comparing to 2~6). Linux scheduling classes are pretty much...OOP, so I think it is really not that bad. The only crappy thing is, you might not be able to boot if you mis-write some codes. Hence, make sure you use snapshots of your VM software. Trust me, you don't want to re-install your instance, re-compile for one hour just because you wrote some code that broke your previous VM instance. Otherwise, you should actually aim for 80+ for this one.\n\nOk, here comes HW5. It's likely to be one about memory paging. Remember I said you should get familiar with Macros, well here you gonna use them a lot in order to walk the page table. Again, start this one early. Prof.Nieh might allow you to submit this HW after the Thanksgiving(If it's fall term). But during Thanksgiving, there will be NO OH held by TA/Prof. Thus, finish it early, or good luck trying to figure why this/that page fault/seg fault occurs by yourself.\n\nHW6 is about Filesystems. It's a long but not that hard one. However, at that point, you will have tons of upcoming final and due on final projects. Hence, a working team is really important here! Tell your teammates not to bother using crappy excuses such as 'oh I have a final so I cannot do anything'. EVERYONE IS BUSY DURING FINAL WEEKS AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE. Don't feel defeated when you open files provided by TAs and found them to be completely empty.(Very cool man, actually giving out a skeleton code without any bones.)  Try to make progress everyday and you are likely to survive through this final HW.\n\nAlright, so much with HWs. Now, time to talk about exams. THEY ARE HARD. If you found sample exams to be easy, IT'S A TRAP. Make sure you re-read assigned chapters s.t. you understand conceptual questions. More importantly, review previous HWs! It's likely there will be coding questions which asks you to modify some previous HWs. If you screwed up some of previous HWs, make sure you read solutions! I would say that solution codes given by TAs are hard to understand, as they might made changes to Linux Kernel in multiple files across different folders. So, make sure you spotted all of them and understand why. TAs are likely to use some Linux Kernel functions that are not covered during lectures, you will want to gank them during OH and post Edstem posts s.t. you can understand what happened. Understanding HWs will help you at least average in exams, thus please take my word on this.\n\nIf you read through all my previous writings, well I wish you good luck. The fact that this course is only 3-credit while AP got 4 is such a joke in my POV. Have fun writing Linux code and I hope you got an A.\nIf you are one of OS staff and is reading this, I suggest you re-consider adding some short sanity check HW on system call implementation. Throwing HW2 on student's face is not that a good idea, most students are not prepared. A sanity check HW will be a good warning as what's gonna come next.\nMerry Christmas:)",

Kernel hacking and OS theory are by nature tougher beasts. There is no easy way to approach the material without severely watering it down. I found AP to be more enjoyable but only because I never felt lost. Yes there were some frustrating debugging moments but I always knew the path the success. OS was different. I felt completely and utterly lost multiple times while doing the hws. I questioned my love of coding, my humanity and my sanity, all while cussing out this class and the kernel documentation. Jae thrusts you into the wild with just the basic necessities (the roadmap for HW7 was generous and appreciated) and we were forced to find our way home. Some can consider this bad teaching. I think of it as tough love. It was necessary to push you to the next level. AP was for teenagers, OS is for adults. Once I became more comfortable with the kernel and its ways (around HW7), I found the class just as enjoyable as AP. Overall, great experience. I only refrain from ranking OS among my favorite courses since I am pretty sure it gave me PTSD. Maybe in a few years I will look back at OS with endearment. \r\n\r\nThe tests....They are much worse than AP's... coming from a guy who got 100 on the AP final. The T/F and multiple questions are really impossible to prepare for. Although the curve evens it out, I think it doesnt give students who've mastered the material a good opportunity to shine. \r\n\r\nIf you loved AP, you'll love this class. You learn a ton. Some example HW's were building a scheduler and a filesystem for Linux. \r\n\r\nI maybe would've liked if Jae spent more time on OS theory and less on Linux specific stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "content": "Given the last review for Professor Nieh was written in 2013, I figured it is worth to share some more thoughts on this class.\r\n\r\nThis class is everything they say it is. Nieh will teach you everything you need to know about Operating Systems, and then some more. His lectures are fast-paced, dense and sometimes difficult to keep track of. However, he is a very good lecturer with an impressive command over the material. He will answer several questions during class, which sometimes gets frustrating as he digresses. If you pay attention, you will learn a lot, but you will often have to back up the concepts with the textbook to actually master the material.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the homeworks. Oh God. Nieh will talk about the concepts in class and he will talk about the homeworks a little bit, but to be honest, you are all alone. They involve writing code into the Linux kernel. Not only do you have to read A LOT (I mean, A LOT) of C code to figure out what you need to do, you also have to be really good at C to actually implement what's expected of you in a reasonable amount of time. Expected to spend 10 hours figuring out what you actually need to do before you write a single line of code. Expect to actually skip homework on other classes to finish these assignments. They will make you a great coder (especially if you want to be a systems programmer), and you will actually master reading Linux source code by the end, but it's a ridiculously rough patch. You will also have to demo your completed homework to a TA after it is done.\r\n\r\nHere are the breakdown of each of the programming assignments:\r\n   - Writing a bash shell. This one is the only individual programming assignment and also the only one not involving kernel programming. It is probably the easiest to do, but it'll still take around ~10 hours to finish. I see this more as a weed-out assignment for the students who aren't as confident in C.\r\n   - Writing a system call to keep track of Android's interprocess communications. This is the first time you will write code for the Linux kernel and also the first time you will write a system call. It's not actually that difficult, but takes a lot to get used to the programming environment.\r\n   - Writing an interface that sleeps selected Android processes and makes them wait on designated light intensity levels. The main emphasis here is concurrency / synchronisation. Starting from this assignment, you will actually be using a physical Android device, which Nieh makes you buy. Expect to pay a total of $200 as a group of three. \r\n   - Writing a process scheduler for Linux. This is easily the most difficult assignment in the class. Most of the teams actually didn't do it and dropped the assignment. My team spent over 30 hours and still got a failing grade. I'd still recommend you to attempt it, since you may be tested on the homework.\r\n   - Exposing process memory to the user. This is the assignment that has to do with memory and paging in Linux. Conceptually can be a pain to figure out, but it's not actually a lot of lines of code. There are some weird Linux-related bugs which slowed us down, so expect to find hacky ways around them.\r\n   - Writing a file system for Linux. This wasn't that bad because the TA's set the homework up pretty well, but just like all the other homeworks, it's again a lot of time.\r\n\r\nDon't expect the grading to be nice because the homeworks are hard. We were constantly tested on weird edge cases that we didn't think of. Nieh expects the highest of you despite how difficult it is to even set up the groundwork for a lot of these assignments.\r\n\r\nTA's: Some are very good and some are very bad. Don't expect office hours to be helpful, they are overcrowded and if there are students scheduled to demo their homeworks, you won't get to even ask questions.\r\n\r\nTextbooks: There are two. One is very helpful for programming for the Linux kernel, especially early on. The other is helpful for the written components of the homeworks and for studying for the midterm and the final. If you could get one, get the Linux programming one.\r\n\r\nBoth of the tests are also difficult, with class averages around 50-60 percentiles. You may be asked on anything you did for this class, from the lectures to the homeworks.\r\n\r\nFinally, grading is OK with a mean around B+, but you leave feeling it could be more generous given how much work and patience this class expects of you to even get a score around the mean. Despite all of that, if you do your work, you will learn an incredible amount about operating systems, C, Linux, systems programming, concurrency, and even more.",

Still, it shows that he put a lot of thought into the way the class and assignments are laid out. I found the order of the material to be pretty natural and easy to follow, but I'm sure the syllabus is still changing every semester as he figures out how to teach this class. \r\nAlthough I found the lectures and readings easy to follow, my team and I really struggled with the homeworks. However, I'll admit that part of the reason that we struggled so much was that we did the readings right before the tests rather than before attempting to do the assignments. So, if you want to make your life easier, do the readings before you get down to coding. There will still be some shooting in the dark involved, but not nearly as much as if you only rely on your knowledge from the lectures. \r\n\r\nThat being said, what made the class truly enjoyable was having an amazing team. None of us knew each other before OS, but we became close friends by the end of the semester because we were spending close to 40 hours/week with each other for this class. It seems like an exaggeration, but I promise its true. We got pretty decent grades on most assignments, but we made very little progress on other assignments (despite the crazy amount of hours we dedicated to working on them). \r\n\r\nThe tests are classic Jae-style trickiness. The curve was pretty generous though. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the material and aren't afraid of some hard work, go for it.

He seemed much less prepared to teach this class. The content wasn't terribly interesting. We spent a lot of time on UNIX APIs and not enough time kernel hacking. It was an 8:40 am class so no one really showed up. It didn't really matter since Jae would just talk about a couple of functions from a man page for an hour any way. Most of the learning is done on your own by reading many chapters from 3 textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe first midterm was poorly written and essentially required you to know random facts from the textbook and didn't really test conceptual thinking. The second was slightly better but still overall not a great test.\r\n\r\nThe HWs were hard. Required a lot of reading of man pages, kernel code and experimenting. Doing it on your own was a miserable experience that led to many sleepless nights. Always felt pressed for time on the group projects. I never felt intellectually challenged by any of it but did feel like it was a lot of worked. There was never an aha moment where I appreciated the beauty of an operating system. It's just a mangled mess that we deal with since that's how some bloke decided things should be done many decades ago.\r\n\r\nEnsure that you form a good team. They don't have to be incredibly smart, just very hardworking, sincere and accountable. Mine didn't do any work which led to a lot of incomplete homeworks since it's kind of impossible for one person to finish the HW on their own unless they're willing to devote well over 10 hrs/week to it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was slightly disappointed in this class given that I thought AP was fun and easy. Jae needs to step up his game here. You might want to take the class with Jason Nieh who is an OS researcher and will focus more on kernel programming, but be warned that his workload is even worse. I do think that every CS major should take OS. It's surprising that Columbia doesn't make it a requirement. That said, I begrudgingly took it.\r\n\r\nTAs for this class were great fwiw.

                "content": "So Jae taught this course in Spring 2014 because the normal OS professor was on leave. I'm not sure when he will teach the course again, but I wanted there to be a CULPA review so that people can go into this well-informed.\r\n\r\n--- The Course ---\r\nI learned a ton from this course, though I didn't necessarily realize it as I was slogging through. Jae reformatted the course and taught it with undergrads in mind, which was appropriate given that the class had many more undergrads than in past years (no doubt because of Jae's popularity). As such, much of the first half was actually an extension of AP (lab7/http-server) used to teach OS concepts such as concurrency, memory sharing, and inter-process communication (user space programs to teach kernel stuff). It again demonstrates Jae's theory of teaching, using previous knowledge in order to bridge the gap to new concepts. With regard to content, Jae put a great deal of time into UNIX programming compared with hardware knowledge / kernel hacking. Jae explains that the earlier stuff is more applicable and the latter stuff is changing (e.g. we didn't cover hard disks, probably because SSDs sort of shift that paradigm). I buy his explanation. The pacing of the course wasn't great, with probably too much time spent on UNIX programming on the front and too little systems/kernel work at the end. Of course, this is understandable given that this was Jae's first time teaching OS and that he completely restructured it.\r\n\r\n--- Homework ---\r\nA few individual assignments (that are pretty easy) with mostly group projects (up to groups of three). Having a good group is obviously helpful. All the projects run on Arch Linux, which you will set up on VirtualBox. The assignments usually didn't involve much coding, but rather a lot of understanding how the code runs and scouring the internet. In other words, frustrating yet also good practice for the real world. The assignments have good underlying structure, but still need refining (again, should get better over time). Sidenote: the listserv from AP carries over as well, and will save you hours of struggle if you follow closely.\r\n\r\n--- Exams ---\r\nI got destroyed on the midterm, but in hindsight it was one of the best crafted CS exams I have ever seen. It definitely tested your ability to read code and apply the concepts we learned. The final was very different and a bad evaluation of our mastery in my opinion: 25 multiple choice questions about very specific things we covered (i.e. very un-Jae-like). Both exams unfortunately do not provide room for partial credit.\r\n\r\n--- Lectures ---\r\nNot incredibly interesting, but still important to really ingrain the material in your head. Jae mostly worked off of powerpoints, which I found ineffective. The few times he used the board were better. For me, printing the notes/slides beforehand and taking notes directly on them worked best.\r\n\r\n--- Grading ---\r\nJae curved to a high B+, which I consider pretty generous. Just be very VERY careful to follow homework instructions exactly as stated. Lots of times grading occurs on scripts, so the slightest problem could send your grade down just for not properly following basic instructions.\r\n\r\n--- TAs --- \r\nJae carried over the best AP TAs and I assume he would do so in the future as well. There was also a contingent of Chinese grad student TAs who were friendly, but generally less helpful.\r\n\r\nI doubt I've covered everything, but hopefully someone after me can fill in any missing gaps. On the whole, I would say to take the class with Jae if you are an undergrad (and if he ever teaches it again).",

                "content": "Hard but not as hard as everyone says. Not very enjoyable but I've had worse classes. If you are a strong programmer with experience in C you will probably do well. If you are a weak or inexperienced programmer you are going to have a bad time. The class could be greatly improved if they reduced the focus on android hacking and emphasized concepts more. The good, mediocre and bad:\r\n\r\n---The good:\r\n- Professor Yang is well-intentioned and prepares for lecture\r\n\r\n- All class notes and materials are easily available on the website\r\n\r\n- Expectations are clear\r\n\r\n- Problem set portions of HW are pretty straightforward\r\n\r\n- Very fast Piazza response\r\n\r\n- Midterm and final are reasonable and open book\r\n\r\n- Exposes students to research (via required paper reading referenced in both lectures and tests, and via frequent observations by Prof Yang during lecture about what are current research topics and how previous topics were explored over time)\r\n\r\n-QEMU/vx6 combo is clear and good to learn from (unfortunately only used in 1 of 6 HWs)\r\n\r\n\r\n---The mediocre:\r\n- Modern Operating Systems textbook is a bit out of date and loaded with thinly veiled opinions, although it's not bad\r\n\r\n- Lectures try to pack way too much material in. Luckily they aren't very relevant, since you can pretty much learn from the slides (and watch portions on CVN if needed) so you don't need to actually go in order to get decent grades on midterm and final. Much of the lecture material is irrelevant to HW and tests \r\n\r\n- Some of the TAs' attitudes to students are borderline insulting (although others are good and very devoted on Piazza)\r\n\r\n- A lot of students seemed very upset about the grading/curving on Piazza at the end although personally I thought it was fine. Prof is reviewing results in response to the outcry (as I mentioned above, it seems he does actually care about the class, even if some aspects of the class are problematic)\r\n\r\n- Group projects. Ugh\r\n\r\n\r\n---The bad:\r\n- Largely useless programming assignments that generally amount to copy pasting and then hacking up existing kernel code. You spend much more time wrestling with various dev tools, resetting your tablet for one kernel crash after another, dealing with complete lack of kernel debugging tools, etc than actually learning OS concepts. The class should really be called \"android hacking\" instead of \"operating systems\"\r\n\r\n- Way too many technologies/tools involved. QEMU emulator, vx6 code, linux kernel code, adb, x86, ARM, complex macros, makefiles, gdb, git, android bootloaders and VMWare just off the top of my head. So again you wind up getting bogged down in tool specific details and spending way too much time on that rather than fundamental OS concepts\r\n\r\n- Extremely slow grading\r\n\r\n- Little relationship between HW (both code and prob sets) and tests\r\n\r\n- \"Interactive\" code grading sessions with TAs. They are intended to encourage fair work-sharing among group members but do nothing of the sort. TAs are not comfortable dealing with the students in person and in fact just skipped doing these for latter HWs\r\n\r\n- Kernel development textbook is bad. Hardly any actual code examples to show how one might add features to the kernel. Mostly high level overviews that are only partially accurate and copy-pastes of comments and headers from existing kernel code (which you can look at on your own without the book)\r\n\r\n- HW4 (scheduling) was painful. Much much harder than other HWs. They let students drop one but they should just get rid of this HW since almost everyone winds up dropping this one anyway and it is by far the worse offender in terms of being useless kernel hacking. Spent the most time on this one, learned nothing I didn't already know and ended up dropping this grade anyway. ADVICE: If you take this course and ace the first three HWs don't even waste a single minute on this one",

Prof. Jason Nieh teaches the course very well.\r\n\r\nApart from the skills and experience in the areas - Operating Systems, Linux kernel programming, this course demands a lot of your \"C\" skills.\r\n\r\nIf you are a HardCore \"C\" fan and would love to experiment at system level in \"C\", then read on!\r\n\r\nThis one class is for those who crave for \"C\" programming a lot! You will get your hands dirty while building crucial features of Linux kernel on an Android device in \"C\" involving Synchronization, Scheduling, Paging, File Systems, etc(as per the projects in Fall 2012).\r\n\r\nYou will fine tune your \"C\" skills yourselves mainly in the area of optimizing the usage of the kernel resources in terms of memory. You keep an eye on what each function ends up returning to determine its success or failure - this comes with practice if you aren't in the habit!\r\n\r\nThe grading rubric is the most comprehensive one I have ever seen in my life. For each of the assignments/homework, the rubric would cover every nook and corner cases that a novice \"C\" programmer for Linux kernel would definitely ignore.\r\n\r\nWell, in the beginning you would find each of your submission being bitten by checkpatch, for not abiding by Linux kernel coding style. But, with time, your \"C\" coding style becomes smooth and elegant if you start respecting what that seemingly strict master(checkpatch) says, trust me!\r\n\r\nAh, userspace programs for each of the assignments! Well, I enjoyed much by dwelling in \"C\" while building the user space test programs for testing the Linux kernel features implemented in each of the assignments. You would be asked to demo each of the Linux kernel features you would implement in each homework and during the demo, well, how dedicated you were in testing your code gets rewarded when the standard test code(which they would have in their repositories) completes without any problem and you hear TA saying, \"That's cool!\".\r\n\r\nTAs were very helpful in answering the questions we had. Sometimes, we had to bug them and get the information what we want - but, they were all nice and had good hold on the subject. Among them, I found through live and piazza discussions, TA - Alex to be damn good in the subject.\r\n\r\nI feel it's important to mention that the solutions they would publish are simply beautiful. The solutions implemented by Christoffer Dall were mesmerizing. No, am not exaggerating at all - his coding style is so pleasing to eye and his code looks very simple and precise!\r\n\r\nPeer reviews: Yes, you would get opportunities(or responsibilities?) to review and grade other people's code. Here, I was annoyed at certain times of seeing some seriously senseless code from other people. At other times, I had also the chance to look at some brilliant code. So, overall, there was a good exchange of knowledge and suggestions between our team and various teams.\r\n\r\nYeah, btw, try to form a good competent team - believe me, it's better to have arguments and come up with some kick-ass code which scores beyond the average code resulting from an average interaction or no interaction at all between you and your teammates. And this is from my experience!\r\n",

Best resource to get help is good TAs. For our course TAs were really good and helpful. I spent almost few hours with them before doing any assignment and it helped.\r\n\r\nCool thing about this course is that if you do assignments on your own and are able to finish it, you will become good enough to answer any question on kernel that you are expected to know and even more.\r\n\r\nMake good teams for your assignment.

Work not so hard and, well, you'll know the theory fairly well, but that's about it. This class requires a highly intimate knowledge of C--if you don't know it very well, then either skip the class or be prepared to read the K&R book thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe course covers the internals of the Linux kernel and we worked specifically with 2.6.11. Nieh covers mostly theory in class, and there is one text which goes over theory in more detail, and one which is a god-awful dry textbook (more like a manual, actually). The assigned readings aren't that long, and you will definitely need to do them--otherwise you will have no idea what the hell is going on. That being said, his lectures compliment the readings very nicely. Nieh was one of my better profs in terms of not \"teaching out of the book.\" However--Nieh is the person you go to if you don't understand theory. If you need help with the homework, skip him and go to the TAs directly (he has little involvement in the homeworks).\r\n\r\nFor each homework, you write a patch to the kernel that does something. After you submit, you have to meet with the TA for ~30 minutes to demo it, and they will also run their own test program on it. Be careful as they are NOT AT ALL forgiving if anything goes wrong--if you can't get it to work (even for a stupid error like you submitted the wrong file), you lose practically all points. Also, each HW has a written portion (~10 questions, usually 50% of the grade).\r\n\r\nHWs:\r\n1. Basic stuff, write a small shell, etc.\r\n2. syscall logger: not that hard, just an introduction to syscalls/the virtual machines you'll be using\r\n3. waitqueues/locking/threading stuff: you don't have to write that much code, just be careful what exactly you write.\r\n4. implemented a new scheduler type. most of the class just skipped this HW entirely, i recommend you give it a shot, but, don't bother if you can't get it.\r\n5. memory tracker: write a syscall that can track what chunks of memory you're using. requires you to go low-level with page tables, etc. tough but doable.\r\n6. process tree filesystem: make a filesystem that reflects the processes on a system. it's a lot easier than it sounds; he gives some examples of other pseudo filesystems in class.",

Keromytis is much worse than that. He's more like a swimming teacher who throws you into a huge pool of acid, then just randomly rambles on about the Summer Olympics. In his lectures, he was always talking about new concepts without introducing them first. Example: one day he was talking about page faults, as if everyone knew what a page fault was. But he had never talked about page faults or pages in class before. I raised my hand and asked \"What's a page fault?\" He said, \"Oh, that's right, I haven't talked about pages yet. I meant to say 'TLB miss', not 'page fault' \". OK, fair enough. But then, a few minutes later, he used the term \"page fault\" again. He STILL hadn't introduced the concept of pages. You need to be aware of what you're saying... Don't assume we know these things, we don't all have like 8 million PhD degrees in CS like you. It's a CLASS. We're there to LEARN. That means most of us didn't know anything about this crap at the beginning of the semester.\n\nKeromytis is one of the many professors at Columbia whose teaching skills were NOT taken into consideration at all when Columbia decided to hire him. If Columbia decided jobs based on teaching skills, Angelos would be fired tomorrow. Basically, he got hired mainly because he's good at acquiring money for the university through research grants.  Learn how to run a class. Oh, wait, I guess you never will learn that.. Columbia has tons of professors who were hired like this. All the most selective colleges in America (the \"top-tier\" colleges) do. It's a serious problem with the American academic world today. Before I started attending Columbia, I heard that the Ivy League colleges were the \"best\" colleges, and I used to believe it. But now, more and more, I'm finding that idea hard to swallow.",

But I didn't expect the professor to show such little commitment to the class. Around the second or third week, he posed the following question to us: \"Does any mind if we don't have class on Thursday, and just have class one day a week?\" No one responded, and this was viewed as consent to literally cut the amount of scheduled class time in half. (I'm not sure how ethical this was, but I didn't want to be the one to complain, and most people just seemed to be in there for the credit.) He claimed we'd cover the same material, but I'm doubtful. I was going to put a complaint about this in my official class review, but it appears we were never given any forms. \n\nAs far as lecturing style, he's pretty straightforward and open to student questions, but it's difficult to discern any passion for the subject matter in his delivery. He doesn't go into much more detail than the slides, and I ended up getting most of what I learned from the book. \n\nHe told us there'd be four quizzes but the first only came about halfway through the term, the second came a couple weeks before the final, and the final two simply didn't come. These quizzes are very unusual in that they're multiple choice, but there is no indication as to how many of the choices are supposed to be circled. And many of the answer selections seem quite borderline, in my opinion. No quizzes or grades of any sort were revealed until the very day of the final exam, which made it very difficult to gauge how much to study. \n\nI was amazed that this class gets you the same credit as the legendary OS class taught by Professor Nieh during the Fall. If you want an easy A in OS, I'd recommend taking this class. But if you want to be challenged, or really learn about the linux kernel, take it with someone else, some time other than the summer. ",

These assignments were very instructive.

He never even asked to see certain parts of the assignment that I knew some people didn't have working. The final OS demo was equally cursory. When I complained to him anonymously about his grading method, he claimed his method was more effective than having him and/or the TA go over the code themselves, and that if I had a problem with how mine was graded individually, I should talk to him about that specifically.

Either hold your breath and scrap together a B, or split up with your boyfriend/girlfriend and move into the lab... just be glad that not all teachers care so little about coddling you as Nieh does. Hopefully, you'll actually learn something in the process, as he knows the material inside-out. And if Linux is old Hat for you, you might possible find yourself enjoying the class.

At this point of my college career, I truly think incompetence of an instructor (not to judge their academic or research capability, just the teaching ability) does not necessarily make or break a class, disorganized staffs definitely do. I was truly upset because despite the syllabus being arduously long, he failed to mention how many written assignments are there and how long they would be (9-10 pages each, questions alone). \n\nI like the content, and after being bullied by the class (and also mildly by Ethan himself, but I am not in his session so I imagine I suffered from less trauma that my peers who had to face him every other day), I still like the content. The book definitely played an important part in maintaining my passion. If you can\u2019t make it to class and slides are not enough, read the book. \n\nRegarding workload, all of the reviews above are legit, although network is complicated, and we kinda need that many materials to do them justice. But, clearer wording and less running-in-circles would cut down time (meaninglessly) spent on the assignments. He clearly doesn\u2019t expect you to finish all of the work for sure as you are given 4 late days (later increased to 5) and at the beginning of the semester, when everyone was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work thrown at them, he repeatedly told you to use them cautiously as projects are weighted more. So the alternatively is basically not submitting the written homework if you were too caught up because each is worth some 1.7% of your grade. If you expect yourself to finish all the assignments, don\u2019t pair this class with any other class that\u2019s heavier than AP or PFP. Doing a non-project but coding-heavy class (think PLT if you don\u2019t have a good group, or malware analysis, distributed system, OS in their own merits) with it is a suicidal move even if you are prepared to discard all other classes.\n\nHe certainly cares a lot about the class, evidenced by the fact that he personally answered most of the Ed posts and responds to email in milliseconds.  But then it also tells you how little role the TAs play - they don\u2019t know shit in OH. Neither do they answer Ed posts, or responsive to email inquiries. In fact in later days I heard from the own mouth of TAs and Ethan\u2019s own PhD students who were taking this class that they had no clue how to do project 2 or many HW questions and that had they not been Ethan\u2019s PhD students but just any other regular CSEE PhD candidates, they would find getting an A in this class near impossible. \n\nHis work ethics is also impressive - working at 4 AM on Christmas Eve and getting up at 9 AM again that same day. But it would not be so fun when you are more or less expected to work on the same schedule. \n\nWith that being said, I would not suggest or endorse any other professors for Computer Networks either. I have heard horror stories about every single of them, not limited to several all-nighters in a row, but the content is nevertheless interesting and I highly recommend. Just take any version of Computer Networks with a clear expectation. \n\n\n",

A good chunk of that midterm dealt with advertising engines' business decisions -- roughly, if they conduct their auction at time X, how does this impact their revenue? -- which has literally nothing to do with networks. In the case of another question, the correct answer was \"sledding in Morningside Heights.\" (Don't ask.) </Preface>\r\n\r\nI think the core of this review can be summed up in a single sentence: \"The lecture slides are in Comic Sans.\" That fact captures the combination of a) trying a bit too hard to be cool (the professor has a pony tail) and b) totally failing to adhere to normal standards of professionalism.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to the review.\r\n\r\nAs others have noted, Chaintreau is an entertaining lecturer but very poorly organized. His assignments are poorly written to the point where virtually every question contains important ambiguities, and important terms and concepts are poorly specified, e.g. we are asked to find property X of a system, but there are multiple conflicting definitions of X and despite repeatedly being asked, the TAs and professor staunchly refuse to pick a particular one. \r\n\r\nThe first programming project (a chat room) had virtually no networking component because you could just use Java or Python's network API; the whole thing amounted to basically just writing lots of switch statements to handle the umpteen-gazillion different chat room commands. \r\n\r\nThe TAs try to be helpful, but their mastery of English is below what's needed to communicate effectively. (NB: This isn't true of just one or two. It's almost all of them. And students from past semesters tell me that's how it was then, too.) Whoever writes the problem sets has the same problem, which is probably a source of some of the ambiguity. That, or sloppiness. Often there are just words missing in the middle of a sentence. They also don't respond usefully to Piazza posts; a non-trivial share of posts get responses like \"well, I think X\", when what we want is not \"what do you think?\" but \"what is the official expectation for students in this class?\"\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, grading is arbitrary -- I'm doing well, so that's not sour grapes talking -- and the solutions are poorly written enough (and dependent enough on particular interpretations of ambiguities in the questions) that it's basically impossible to argue your grade.\r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention that the textbook sucks? It feels like one of those high school chem textbooks, in that it both doubles nicely as a doorstop and is jam-packed with unnecessary verbosity and cute little asides about real-world applications. There are glossy graphs, and maybe an equation every 30 or so pages. Not coincidentally, the book seems like it's written for a high school student, or maybe a smart middle school student. It is decidedly not written with the time constraints and intellect of a college student in mind, particularly not those who have spent enough time immersing themselves in CS to be taking a 4000-level class. Protocols are never proved correct, elementary concepts like a hash function are explained at length, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhat this class needs is a big dose of rigor, not to mention a more disciplined professor. So, please, Columbia, can you get Jae Lee to teach this class, too? Give him a time-turning or something. I'm sure he'll do it.",

The second in particular was poorly designed. Once one was able to translate the second assignment into English, it was incredibly difficult to program. The second assignment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sections had a lot of functional overlap, but this overlap was difficult to capitalize on due to unnecessarily unstandardized features throughout the assignment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear if AC wrote the assignments or if the TAs did. Either way, most of the TAs were not nearly helpful enough in explaining the assignments. \r\n\r\nThe Ugly: For the spring semester that I had him, AT THE END OF MARCH, he changed the grading scheme as follows \r\n10% ->15% for Prog Assignment 1 \r\n10% ->15% for Prog Assignment 2\r\n25% ->15% for Midterm\r\nAC did not announce this change.

His assignments are unclear and leave you dumbfounded as to what you are supposed to produce, usually a very lengthy Q/A on his website follows with frustrated students probing explanations as to what the assignment actually means.\r\n\r\nProgramming assignments are impossible unless you are not taking any other classes and have done extensive network programming before. Yechiam Yemini does not go so far as to talk about programming in class. EVER. Unless you've already done it you don't have a shot at the programming assignments, which are just as cryptic as the written assignments. Also be ready to drop some cash on a CLIC account if you don't have one, all assignments are submitted via virtual machines on CLIC. Deadlines are also very short, usually about 10 days for extremely high involvement work\r\n\r\nI really wanted to like this class, the topic is important and the class deserves a better professor. Wait for Dan Rubenstein or someone else to teach it before you take it. \r\n\r\nWriting this review is making me physically upset.\r\n\r\nOther than that, he seems like a really nice guy and I don't think he means to cause heartache.

He is one of the best professors I have had at Columbia in CS. After having taken both Fundamentals and Networks with him, I highly recommend him.\r\n\r\nHis lectures are spread between writing on the board and going over lecture slides that the textbook made. Both are pretty good, but when he writes on the board, he can go really fast. If you don't want to fall behind in class when he's writing on the board, don't copy everything down (though I did, and I often got lost). Listen though and ask questions. The textbook might serve as a good resource. I referred to it several times, but you could probably get away with just using Wikipedia. There's no assigned reading but he does cover nearly everything in the textbook (and more).\r\n\r\nHomeworks are reasonable. The first two programs are the hardest, but after that they just get easier (and even easier still). Do yourself a favor and do them in Java, trying to do the noble thing and programming in C just won't cut it. The first program will take 40+ hours in C, or 10 hours in Java. Your choice. You have plenty of time for the programs. The separate theory homeworks are assigned with only 1 week to do them (sometimes concurrently with the programs), so if you don't start early they can be tough.\r\n\r\nHis tests and theory problems work the same way. You learn the basic concepts in the class. Then you're asked questions that rearrange problems to something you've never seen before and are something that was covered in class. The only way you can do well is if you have a strong understanding of the material (obviously).\r\n\r\nHe is a fair/generous grader and a nice guy if you go to his office hours. Listen, ask questions in class, start the programs relatively early (and do them in Java!), know the concepts and you'll do fine. Usually the class has a low average too.\r\n\r\nDo take this course even if it's not required for your track. Unlike some CS classes, the material is actually interesting and relevant to so many things. No abstract theoretical stuff that you can't relate to anything.

There are a few ways he can improve this class.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he teaches the class from a very theoretical point of view.  Considering this course is described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Introduction to computer networks,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he needs to focus less on the theory.  The theory he teaches is excessive to the point that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for me to follow how the theory relates to networking in real life.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with theory, but first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to learn something practical so that I know how to apply the theory.\r\n\r\nProf. Rubenstein clearly states that he does not follow the book.  I understand that many professors do not follow the book because they need to present material that relates more closely to the course.  Unfortunately, in this situation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big mistake.  Based on the course description, the material in the book is better than what Prof. Rubenstein teaches.\r\n\r\nCompared to other classes, Prof. Rubenstein also puts a lot of weight on the mid-term and final.  Based on the amount of effort I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to put in to the homework and programming assignments, I think the assignments should be a larger factor in the overall grade.  He barely teaches anything in class on how to do the programming assignments.  This leaves students with a lot of work although it only counts for a small portion of the grade.\r\n\r\nI would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve liked to learn about networking in this class, but unfortunately it looks like all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned is strange theory that I have no idea how to apply to real life.  I think Prof. Rubenstein could do a decent job teaching the course if he would just read the course description one more time and realize that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to teach anything other than what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presented in the textbook.  Save the theory for a different class, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give it to us in the introduction to networks class.\r\n",

                "content": "First of all, Rubenstein is a little insecure. At least that's the first impression he gave to me, and I write this knowing full well that he's going to read this review. In the introductory lecture, he spent a full five minutes explaining why the reviews of him that were posted on CULPA are unfair. \nWhile I've heard professors respond to CULPA reviews before, I've never seen anyone get so defensive about one. \nIt leaves you with the impression that he feels like he's got something to prove, which is unfortunate since he's not a bad teacher.\n\nUnfortunately, for all the time he spent preparing his defense of his CULPA reviews, he never really seemed to spend enough time preparing to teach the course. The fact that he doesn't like any of the books out there isn't by itself a problem, but he needs to understand that there are people who like to be able to use books as a reference, to supplement lectures. The fact that he didn't decide whether to teach the course top down or bottom up until the second lecture meant that he couldn't recommend a book that covers the material in the same order that he would. This meant that those of us who tried to use the book he suggested to help with the early material were stuck with references to things that wouldn't be covered until the end of the course. How difficult would it have been for him to take the time to make that decision just a few days earlier so that he could suggest a book that could complement his lectures?\n\nLikewise, despite requests from several students, he never produced any kind of schedule for the course. No one had any way of knowing what would be covered, when it would be covered, or when the assignments would be due. This was especially problematic around midterms, when people are trying to budget their time, and Rubenstein decided to give out the information pertinent to assignments at the very last minute.\n\nI don't have a problem with teaching networks from a theoretical perspective, but I wish he spent more time talking about networks early on and less time trying to justify his decision to teach the way he does. Furthermore, everyone in the class has already taken a stats course of some sort, since it's a prerequisite for the course. It really wasn't necessary to spend 3 lectures early on explaining about expected value, especially since there was no schedule that people who already understood stats could refer to so that they could skip the redundant sessions.\n\nThe assignments were the kicker. He's certainly not the first CS professor I've had who's extremely rigid about assignment deadlines, but usually the ones who are that rigid are obsessive compulsive about posting the assignments well in advance and making sure that the project specification is detailed enough to avoid problems. Instead, Rubenstein would give out assignments usually a day or three after he promised, only to have to go through several rounds of revisions to account for mutually contradictory requirements within the project. It's not that the assignments are bad, just that he doesn't seem to take enough prep time to really set them up properly ahead of time.\n\nAs for his exams, he takes great pride in making them hard, which is certainly his right. The trick is to understand that he'd always rather ask a question designed to trick people than directly test their understanding of the underlying concepts. While it's useful to understand the concepts, you need to go into his exams trying to find the places where he's trying to trip you up. Unfortunately, this means that performance on the tests is at least as much about your ability to outsmart Rubenstein as it is about whether or not you're learning about computer networks.\n\nAll told, don't go out of your way to take any classes with him. He's not bad at standing in front of a room and explaining things, but he seems thoroughly uninterested in spending sufficient time preparing to teach. As for the theoretical angle he likes to take, it's not as bad as the other review would indicate, I just wish he hadn't wasted everyone's time with remedial stats in order to do it.",

This modern, dynamic, complex topic that is fascinating to me in all other contexts was presented so that his students will assume they are bad at it, and will shy away from it for the rest of their career.  \nThe best analogy I can think of is, it was like we were starving and all decided to try sushi for the first time.  When we arrived, instead of bringing us delicious sushi, we were brought a dead fish that we had to dissect using our hands, all the while being criticized by the sushi chef for our poor technique.  We all left slightly sick to our stomachs and unlikely to try out sushi again anytime soon.\n\nYou won't get any big pictures here.  You won't learn about any actual protocols in use today.  You won't hear any of the vocabulary everyone else in the industry uses to describe network phenomena.  But on the upside, you will use all of that probability and discrete math that you thought had no real-world application.  \nHe says that he doesn't concentrate on details (usually after he's just been called out for getting them incorrect), but every concept we discuss is presented as a mathematical proof.  This means that you will leave his class not knowing how to use the word \"bandwidth\", but you will be able to draw the min-max fluid model of traffic flow.  \nBottom line: unless you're an EE major, don't take this class.  If you absolutely have to, at the very least, don't assume that this is all there is to networking.  Promise me you'll give it another try some other time.\n\n",

He clearly has a great depth of knowledge in the field, his digressions are good, and he's very personable and approachable.\n\nSome things to be prepared for, though:\n\n* His lecturing style is very dry, delivered in a low rumble. I was really interested in the material and was able to look past this to some extent, but it was sometimes hard to keep my mind from wandering. It also meant that much of the class wasn't all that strongly engaged, which de-energized the room.\n\n* The lectures were fairly applicable to the exams, but weren't all that helpful for the homework assignments. This, in combination with their dryness, plus the online availibility of lecture notes, is probably what caused most of the class to stop going to lecture starting about 1/3 of the way through the semester. This de-energized the classroom further.\n\n* Professor Yemini tries to make the initial assignments harder and the assignments later in the semester easier; his feeling is most C.S. classes operate in the opposite manner, and it's nice to counterbalance that. This isn't a bad philosophy.\n\n* There's a definite effort to make the homework assignments and the exam questions non-cliched and interesting. The results of this are a bit hit-and-miss, though. In the first programming assignment, for example, it was very difficult to divine what the project was supposed to do based on the specification. Others in the class spent hours upon hours spinning their wheels until they understood; I settled for a lower grade on that assignment. The second programming assignment, an RMI MUD server (with a reasonably constrained world-state to keep track of), in contrast, was a lot more fun.",

I had some expectation that the animation course would similarly involve quite a bit of physics and math, and I wasn't disappointed in this respect.  The bulk of the grade comes from assignments broken up into themes and milestones.  There is an assignment every week, with the implementation of basic gravitational and spring forces, collision detection, time integration using the explicit and implicit Euler methods, rigid bodies, and finishing up with fluid simulation. We did not get to the final assignment because there was a lot of difficulty getting the preceding ones done in time and the deadlines had to be extended nearly every week. \n\nI attended a few of Professor Zheng's lectures, and while I had no complaints with his teaching style, I just didn't find them to be wholly necessary because the handouts that come with each assignment are so thorough, you pretty much just need to read and re-read them to be able to complete the assignments.  This is not to say that any of the assignments are easy, however.  There are test cases that must be passed, and it's very easy to fail them even when your animation looks correct because of small residuals.  Unfortunately, there is also no partial credit, as the assignments are graded by an autograder.  You either pass the tests with no residuals or your score suffers.  There were a lot of complaints in the class because of this, and it made it probably one of if not the most challenging courses I've taken at Columbia.  I easily spent 30+ hours each week on the assignments.  Many involve math derivations and tons of debugging to get the program running properly and passing the test cases.  One involves devising your own algorithm as part of a contest, reading research papers for some ideas.  This was perhaps the most difficult assignment, and my own implementation using bounding boxes worked fine on individual test cases but couldn't scale up with thousands of particles, so I only got partial credit.\n\nDespite the difficulty and the very short turnaround time on the assignments, I felt very gratified by the end of the semester at having completed everything.  The course has a level of rigor you don't often see and I feel the struggle taught me a lot.  In terms of math, you should be familiar with linear algebra and taking second-order partial derivatives.  Make sure you read each of the handouts for the assignments thoroughly and many times as you work through them.  There are tips, hints, and just general information you will need to know to successfully complete everything and get your programs running.  All assignments are done in C++, the same as the graphics course, so you will need to be familiar with it.  The Ed discussion forum was not very active, but the few people who were on there helped each other out.  The TAs for the class were fantastic as well, sharing very useful tips and derivations to be able to complete some of the assignments.  Overall, I would definitely recommend the course if you're up for a challenge and really want to learn the physics and math that go into creating animation.  The simulations you'll be running are very rudimentary, but seeing your work come to life gives you some idea of what can be done at a more advanced level in this field.",

You will need to start each milestone basically the day it comes out in order to have a chance of finishing it and passing the tests of the autograder. I don't think the grading is entirely fair, as one can have a working program that gives a roughly correct animated simulation, but there can be residuals that cause the tests to fail and no partial credit given.  I also think the assignments should be extended out to 1-1/2 weeks at minimum to complete, as they are so involved and require so much debugging that you essentially need to work on them every day of the week for multiple hours to have a chance of finishing on time.  Every deadline was extended, and we even had an assignment due during the week of Spring Break.  The work was unrelenting and there were multiple complaints on the discussion forum.  I enjoyed the milestones a lot, so it wasn't a big deal for me personally, but it was definitely stressful and frustrating at times not being able to complete an assignment to my satisfaction because I simply ran out of time."

It singlehandedly made me question taking the Vision/Graphics track as a CS Major.\n\nWhile the content of the class that resides at the intersection of computer science, physics, and applied math sounds very compelling, the structuring of the assignments takes away heavily from that appeal. For one thing, the assignments had hidden skeleton code for some mysterious reason that I honestly still don't understand to this day that makes it harder to understand what each of the functions do. Towards the start of the semester, that in combination with the lack of commenting/documentation made the assignments more of a hassle than they really could've (and should've been). \n\nThen, some of the assignments involved reading research papers that were so heavily disjointed from each other to the point of again, making the assignments harder than they could've and should've been. An example that comes to mind is the T2M3 assignment (Theme 2, Milestone 3), where we had to implement an algorithm for particle collision detections that was more efficient than quadratic (O(N^2)) time complexity. For that assignment, only one of the algorithms were fast and accurate enough in actuality to pass the test cases - all of the others (including the ones actually mentioned in the recommended research papers) were obsolete. I spent days implementing one of them, just for it to fail all of the test cases.\n\nThere were other assignments that were just freakishly hard because of the time taken to complete them being heavily padded by complex derivations, namely T2M2. The one equation that involved vector arithmetic in combination with algebra took me several hours to derive, just for it to be incorrect, where I had to go back in and spend even more hours re-deriving it, just for it to still be incorrect. I eventually just had to leave that assignment unfinished, just like 2 others out of the 10 we've been given to do.\n\nLastly, the final involved doing derivations by hand, which I feel EXTREMELY weary about given T2M2. It's also such a departure from the work we had otherwise spent doing during the semester, to the point where my hopes aren't very high for how it'll end.\n\nIf you're seeing this, you're likely not following the Vision/Graphics track as a CS Major, as it would've been out-of-phase in lieu of the new \"general\" track. And in that case, I heavily recommend doing yourself a favor and take any other class.",

Grinspun is a very well known and accomplished professor who is passionate about his work, as well as an enthusiastic and organized lecturer. Take this class late in your CS career - the more programming experience you have, the better.\r\n\r\nHomeworks are difficult, but you are provided with a code base that provides visual debugging tools, as well as a grading script with numerous tests that gives you an accurate idea of the performance (and final grade) of your code. All homeworks come with a PDF explaining the physics concepts behind the code for that week, and although there were some errors, the PDFs were for the most part very helpful, especially if you happened to miss a lecture. (In the case of mistakes in the PDF, extensions were often given)\r\n\r\nTo prepare: learn linear algebra, refresh your knowledge of differential calculus (mandatory), be a strong C++ programmer, and, although it is not listed in the course requirements, I STRONGLY recommend some kind of physics background. While Grinspun does go over this material in class, if you start with at least one college-level physics class under your belt, the lectures and homeworks will be much more comprehensible, and you won't waste time learning elementary physics.\r\n\r\nGrading: I include this section to discuss some grading policies I disagreed with. 85% of the homework grade comes from the \"bot\", or the test suite mentioned earlier. The other 15% comes from a mandatory creative scene, built by you to showcase the elements developed for that weeks milestone. At the beginning of the class, Grinspun said you do not need artistic skill to succeed in this class. However, I disagree. If your code works 100% according to the script, you could still get a B on the assignment if you fail to produce a good creative. These creatives are then judged by your peers, who determine the remaining 15% of your grade. Humorous creatives can outweigh visually pleasing creatives, so if you're in a time crunch, go for that. The professors and the TA's weigh in on these grades, so they may give you more points if they see technical ability not easily recognized by your peers.\r\nExtra credit is awarded for the top 5 creative scenes, and sporadic extra credit is offered throughout the semester on the homeworks (when it is offered, it is a lot! Do it!)\r\n\r\nExams: None. There is a final project worth the weight of two \"milestones\"/homeworks, which is left up to you. You could modify the code base to produce an extravagant creative, implement a technical paper, or implement algorithms from the class in an external software - whatever you want.\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you have any interest in computer graphics or animation, take this class. It will either weed you out, or light a fire under you to go farther in the field. It's a love-it or hate-it class, since you will have to really commit, but if you want to be in this field, you cant miss this opportunity.",

There are only assignments and projects, no exams. Assignments 1-6 helps you practice the web dev stuff you learn in class (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Flask). The Midterm project, which is an individual project, builds on to Assignment 6 (a database website with the topic of your choice) by adding more features and also focusing on graphic design. The Final project, which is encouraged to be done in groups (you choose your own groups as long as your group members are in your TA session, and you can make an exception with your TA to work on it individually), allows you to create a website teaching users a topic of your choice. \nProfessor Chilton highly encourages students to use ChatGPT in their assignments and projects, which made this class easy. However, I would encourage you to still engage with the learning process to really benefit from this class. Even if ChatGPT doesn't help, there are 32 TAs holding OHs every week. Note that Professor Chilton does not give out any A+s.\nUnlike HWs 1-6 and the projects, some parts in HWs 7-12, which were used to guide students in their final projects, felt like busy work, but I found many parts of them to be very helpful because you can create your prototype and your TA will give you feedback on it. Also, HW instructions often had typos, and I feel like sometimes in the lectures after Spring Break, Professor Chilton repeats the same topics.\nSome HWs focused on website functionality, while others focused on both website functionality and graphic design. \nIf you want to explore web dev (both the coding and graphic design aspects of it), check out this class!",

It often seems like we\u2019re being used as part of an iterative trial-and-error process. Unfortunately, the TAs only make things worse. They are unhelpful, disrespectful to students, and difficult to work with(at least for the ones I had contact with). Scheduling mandatory group meetings is a challenge, questions on Ed rarely get answered, and the grading process\u2014despite having a rubric\u2014feels subjective and unclear.\nThe TA assigned to my group, in particular, made the experience far worse(one is the head TA). They seemed entitled, focused more on their own preferences than on supporting students. For instance, we were required to submit video explanations for coding assignments (because grading code directly was \"too much trouble\"), and the TAs insisted the video links be included in multiple places\u2014like the README file, Gradescope, and sometimes even an answer PDF. If there were mistakes in the homework instructions, they wouldn\u2019t clarify or answer questions, which only added to the confusion.\nI\u2019ve also heard there are some good TAs in the course, but unfortunately, my experience was very different.

It was split into multiple phases \u2013 coming up with ideas as individuals, narrowing down ideas as a group, selecting final ideas as a group, creating wireframes for the idea, coloring the wireframe, then lastly, coding up the website.

The lectures are useless, so just be sure to fill out your participation form (participation is 15% of your grade and can be as easy as responding \"Yes\" at an appropriate interval in the zoom chat. Yes, you can fib on the form with virtually no chance of the TAs noticing). Extensions are generously given, regrades markedly less so.\nThe semester is divided into two pieces: the first half \"teaches\" (i.e. gives basic demos in class and then sends you off to Google) Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Flask, as well as visual design principles. The homeworks associated with this are either capricious (see arbitrary grading above) or maddeningly difficult. As someone with no previous JS experience the learning curve was shall we say steep. Homeworks range in time from 5 hours on the first to maybe 25 on the fifth.\nThe first half culminates in a midterm project worth 10% of your grade over the course of two weeks. This took about 40 hours. It is as unpleasant as the hours suggest.\nThe second half of the semester was dominated by a \"project\" which was a lot of tedious \"feedback-giving,\" \"iterating,\" and other design processes. These homeworks can be completed in <2 hours, an insult to the assignments that came before it. The project is very tedious but not difficult.\nThe class is not curved, but unless you slack off it is pretty much impossible to get below an A-.",

Her personality really shows through her lectures--you'll learn about all her favorite things: Star Trek, The Office, DDR, The Knicks, what the world's best boarding pass looks like. Her lectures are not heavy and very easy to pay attention to since she's so great at talking and is just so excited! She also does a good job of guiding people through the design process, focusing your attention on the little details and potential areas of frustration. Her slides have everything you need for the material, and I often find that it's enough to just pay attention. She also ends class early frequently and gives a nice summary after every lecture.\r\n\r\nFrom someone with no webdev background, it would've been nice if she taught some basic technical stuff i.e. JS, HTML, CSS. To be fair, webdev is hard to learn without trying it yourself, and the functions you need are often specific to what you want to implement. Our first programming hw was a static replica of the Gmail interface, which killed me as a newbie. Her written HWs are a bit subjective since she seems to have an answer in her head that she's looking for, and it's not always clear as to how much of an explanation is enough. The final project for this class is spread across 6 weeks, and she provides \"milestones\" along the way to keep you on track. She also emphasizes the importance of early feedback in the design process and allots class time for feedback exchange between peers. Overall, if you have some kind of front end experience, this class should be chill.\r\n\r\nThere is a \"participation\" component of the grade that is annoying for many, because your name has to be recorded by a TA hidden in the back of the room. Lydia likes to engage the class with short answer questions, and will call on people to speak. Your participation grade is almost entirely dependent on how well she can remember your name, and how hard the TAs try to figure out who spoke. Apparently the TAs came up with a scheme to remember where each of the three asian Kevins sat. It's often unfortunate for me to be one of the many shoulder length haired asian girls in the class, and it's a small victory on my part on those rare occasions when she gets my name. She definitely needs a better system to track participation, but if she doesn't establish one, I'd advise you to dye your hair purple before taking her class.",

Unless you have a photographic memory, you are not going to do well.

For example, 20% of the test was based on one random paragraph from one of the many articles. Another 20% was based on a topic he spent literally 5 minutes talking about during a lecture. Why is this a bad idea? It rewards students that have better memories or, to a lesser degree, that happen to get lucky because they studied the 1% of material that shows up on the tests.

He tries to be a good guy (I guess) by telling you how to prepare for exams and then says \"do all the [voluminous, outdated] reading and review your class notes,\" as though that's helpful -- and then asks a couple of questions on the exams that are calculated to punish all but those who memorized the course material. 40% of the midterm, for example, was based on a topic covered by 3 pages in the text and a couple of his slides -- all of which seems faintly  sadistic.  The individual HW's were interesting; there could have been more of them. The team projects, as always, were an aggravating waste of time.

It is a field that is completely ignored in ALL other classes, and it is quite important. Unlike most courses in the department  it actually practical and applicable to anything you'll ever program. I do agree with all previous (bad) reviews. However, the problem with the allegedly harsh grading of the homework is that most of the grade is not based on functionality. Your program may follow all specs, but still get a C. It is the USER INTERFACE that gets you most of the credit. And you can only start thinking of user interface AFTER you completed all specs, which is usually around 5am the night before it is due. And that is truely a big problem with this class. But as you know from the previous reviews, you get some penalty-free late days to use on any combination of the first 3 (!!!)assignments. Another major problem is that there is a lot of reading, and it is all asked about in the midterm and final. As a rule of thumb, if there is a formula of some sort in any of the papers, it will appear eventually on a test. You will probably have to state it and explain it. Nothing too fancy, but you do need to memorize a bunch of them like it's a high-school history test. Not the end of the world, though. \nIt is true, this class feels more like a Humanities class that a regular CS class. You have to read a lot papers, and there are never problem sets (only programming projects with minor explanations of \"why did you choose the interface that you did\"). It is, though, not the hardest class you have taken or will take in the department, and it opens a window to a very neglected (and again, practical) area of compters. Lets face it, in the real world, your boss/client is much more likely  to care about the interface of your program. And like in this class, they are going to take the functionality as a given.",

As a rule of thumb, after reading every chapter ask yourself 5 feasible questions he can ask. It's pretty obvious. There is no way around reading all research papers, and don't fool yourself you will have enough time to read even a quarter of them during finals.  However, like in every class like this, nobody has time to do all the reading and there's a curve. The midterm and final consist only of essay questions. The trick is that if you understand the general theory (mostly from the book) and use \"the UID language,\" you can totally b/s and get some partial credit on occasion. Finer travels a lot, so there are many occasions that there is a gust lecture, some of them really cool."

He is impossible to approach, because he seems to believe that students (and their questions) are below him.  The three homework assignments here were not hard (about 15 hours each, roughly), but the final project was tough only because of the demo.  Doing a demo with Feiner is basically him apathetically saying \"mm hm\" every two seconds to your explanation, and then bringing up every bad aspect of your program to you that he can find in the 5 minute span and grilling you on it.  Tests are tough, too.  Feiner holds you responsible for those research papers on his tests, which are entirely essay form.

For example, Prof Drinea taught us step-by-step methods for solving DP problems and proving reductions which made them much easier to grasp. \n\nShe is also a solid lecturer, although a bit of a fast talker, and did a great job of building each topic from the ground up. She also posed comprehension questions to the class during each lecture to make sure we were following. Her slides were also quite comprehensive and she gave detailed and quick responses to Ed posts.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this course- it is way more useful than trying to memorize solutions to Leetcode problems. You'll actually get good at solving them and learn some cool (and relevant) algorithms along the way. ",

                "content": "I have a lot to say about this class, some of which is in response to what has already been said. I'll try to keep my argument structured and evidenced and give my final review at the end. For context, I'm an undergraduate junior who's already taken enough 4000 level classes in the department to feel confident vouching for these opinions. \n1. First things first, I agree with the other posts on the disorganization and intense workload of the class. Analysis of Algos is one of the most intense workload classes I've taken at Columbia (not the hardest, but a lot of work). It would've helped to have a reasonable routine for problem sets and for quizzes/readings, and it is really troubling that this was not followed. I agree that as a class, it's insane that we have to deal with this in the middle of an online sem. It's also crazy how a little bit of everything counts, so you cannot really slack off on any parts. The lectures are very fast, and it's not possible to keep up with the class at all points of time, with the readings the core resource in helping to follow. \n2. I do not agree with the assessment of the TAs, and especially name-dropping of the TAs in the post -- it's unfair and gives a very biased view of what happens in class. In my opinion, Max Helman and the team (despite their quirks) have done their best to be helpful. I think the grading is a bit too harsh with too many requirements, and rubrics need to be more precise, but this is common to most Algos sections. Previous posts mention that its ridiculous to have 3 hws, a project and a final in the final weeks of the class and I fully agree, but it's worth noting that the students voted to have a project to take the weight off of the final, and that the TA team orchestrated that the request was heard. I too voted for the project and it was a bad decision in hindsight, but this was not a TA decision to add more work. In my opinion, the TA team has been resourceful and responsive on Piazza despite being uncertain from time to time about logistics which I doubt were in their control. I had many instances asking for readings + homework, and was told that this decision had not been taken on a professor level despite them following up. This brings me to my final point:\n3. Christos Papidimitriou is a legend of the CS world. He teaches this class once in a while because he feels like it, and out of a pure passion for algorithms. The passion is apparent in his fast-paced lecturing style and the breadth of his syllabus. It's very rare to have a professor who's written the textbook of the class, and even rarer to have one of the smartest people in the world as your Prof with the crazy CS network Prof. Christos has: including the likes of the founding members of Google and Microsoft and several dozen Turing Award winners and award-winning textbook authors that are his friends. He has contributed to evolutionary biology as he has to game theory, to complexity theory as he to database theory. I think when people sign up for his class, people are looking for the experience of learning from a 'famous' professor. And I think the disorganization in the class is purely a consequence of the same: he's a very busy person who wants to say a lot about a lot of things. This by no means is trying to say it's ok to not pay attention to the requirements of the students. As I've said before, I disagree with how lectures and organization for the class went. I just think that the status of Prof. Christos's achievements along with the fact that he infrequently teaches the course means that the structure can get a bit haywire, not as a consequence of TA involvement but rather purely as an artifact of everything he wants to cover and how he relays this.\nFinally, I want to note all this is true of a zoom semester. There's close to no interaction in the lectures or breakout rooms and it's so easy to fall behind in class, after which the mandatory attendance requirement means that loads of people attend for the sake of it. naturally, the online learning environment does not lend itself to question answering beyond those that are already confident of the material and this contributes to the issue. I would not generalize from what I've written above or what others have written of the Spring 2021 iteration to beyond the online medium. \nFinal outcome: \n\nAgree with: heavy workload, fast lectures, disorganized content\n\nDisagree with: evaluation of the intentions and commitments of teaching staff. I think they've tried their best to help through the semester and the haywire experience is more a consequence of the general direction of the syllabus + online medium.\n\nSummary: take this class if you want the experience of having prof. Papadimitriou as your professor and want to flex about it for the rest of your Columbia journey and CS education career for when he wins his next big award. Don't take it if you expect light workload + easy psets related to the core algorithms taught in a more traditional algorithms sequence. Don't make a decision on whether to take it from looking at the TAs, but instead do so based on your expectations for the class. I doubt a change of staff will do one bit to alter the direction Prof. Christos takes his syllabus and expectations.",

Only take this class if you are extremely self-disciplined and a genius in CS. A lot of people in this class are graduate school students, so if you are an undergraduate, be prepared to get lost at the beginning of the class. There are almost 100 people in this class, but there really aren't too many people participating due to the poor lecture structure and his teaching. I don't understand the majority of the things he teaches and have to rely on the textbook and self-learning 99% of the time. As an undergrad, I think this probably doesn't apply to a lot of the classmates coz there are a lot of graduate students, who probably have already seen most of the things taught in this class. Even though it's on zoom, he requires attendance, but I can't follow at all. There are always geniuses in this class who understand everything and make the professor think that everyone in the class understands what he's talking about. He enjoys putting us into breakout rooms, but NO ONE, literally NO ONE, talks in the breakout room (I'm not even sure whether people are actually listening to the course). He goes through everything pretty fast because you are supposed to understand everything deeply in the textbook before coming to the class, so you are basically fu.ked up if you don't do the readings. The content of this course is super important, but I really don't recommend Christos at all unless you learn everything on your own.",

I want to preface this with the fact that I am taking his algos class during a Zoom semester, so I'm sure it's hard for everyone, including the TAs and the professor, but the class is incredibly disorganized. We have mandatory quizzes before every lecture on the lecture material (which, although aren't worth a lot of our grades, are still stressful to have to worry about). The readings that these quizzes will be on and the quiz itself are often not posted until 10 PM or later the day before our 10:10 AM class, and we are supposed to take the quizzes before the lecture starts. Weekly psets are also sometimes posted late (posted Friday and due before Wednesday morning).

This course was taught 'alongside' Prof Andoni's Analysis of Algorithms 1 course, and twice this semester Prof Stein couldn't teach and he had Andoni fill in with his own slides. After experiencing both professors, I can confidently say that Stein is much more concise, thorough, and more familiar with the material. I mean, he is a co-author of the textbook...\r\n\r\nAs far as workload, there were 6 problem sets with the lowest one dropped. These took a substantial amount of time if you actually go through the process of thinking and devising/modifying algorithms to solve them (the alternative is to google them and either find the solution posted or something similar that you can pull off as a sort-of answer). Two midterms for 25% each, and one final for 35%. First midterm I did terribly, second I did average, and final I also scored average. On the homeworks, I started off scoring 2 SD's below median, and slowly worked my way up to the median/above. Constant and steady improvement is definitely key, as I walked away with a B. \r\n\r\nThe material is challenging, but office hours are helpful. Reading the textbook is a must... especially if you miss class, you have everything you need to know in the textbook. Stein follows it perfectly, and it is written in the same language he teaches in (duh! he wrote it!), so its easy to follow along.\r\n\r\nThis class was extremely helpful for interviewing. I took it Fall 2019, as I was applying to full-time CS roles. Definitely helpful for analyzing runtime, using algorithms, modifying algorithms, optimization, etc. I recommend taking it, the topics taught in this class are extremely helpful to someone looking to be a good programmer, engineer, algorithm designer, etc.",

He has pre-made slides, which could have some typos, but his lectures can be a little different. He is a good lecturer and very helpful during OH. \r\n\r\nAlgo I covers a lot of topics in just one semester. If you think it's an upper level data structures class, then I want to tell you it's much more than that. It's like C++98 to C++17. I just want to say that we really learn a lot of different algorithms and the proofs about their correctness. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets are mostly exercises from CLRS, our textbook. Some problems on them are doable, some are not (not for me, sad). I had to go to OHs to figure out where to start for some of the homework problems. Midterm and final are about the same difficulty but midterm was given shorter time. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about grades, but the amount I learned is enough for me to not care. Although there are much more master students and a few PhDs, I think the number of undergrads taking this class is about 20. Very happy :)\r\n\r\nSome advice:\r\nread the textbook; it takes iterations (for me) to understand things. \r\ngo to OH if you can; TAs are totally amazing, they see a problem and they solve it already. \r\nstart the problem sets early because they could literally take 20+ hrs to do; I typed in latex which takes time too. \r\n\r\nWho might enjoy taking this class: love solving puzzles, when you get to know some underlying reason of how this works (usually related to math) you will get excited, can find connections between different concepts, want to rigorously prove something, etc. \r\n\r\nPrereq: I was doing okay without CS theory, but I would consider discrete math a must.

There is some new material, but it doesn't feel like a semester's worth. Overall, the material was not particularly interesting. I guess you learn all the standard algorithms you should know: the theory of divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithms, then some classic sorts and graph algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were fine. A little slow, but presented reasonably. The slides are online, which is nice, and the textbook is pretty standard. The level of rigour was adequate.\r\n\r\nHowever, the homeworks were painful. The problems themselves were not hard, but the TAs were brutal. They often complain about a supposed \"lack of rigour\". In a good math of theory class, you're supposed to write however much you need to show what you know. But in this class, you're supposed to write however much you need to show a toddler how to do it themselves. This felt like a waste of time for the students and the graders.\r\n\r\nThe exams were graded much more forgivingly, though. \r\n\r\n",

                "content": "Professor Drinea is a solid pick for Algorithms I and she has taught for the past two spring semesters. Here is what you are in for:\r\n\r\nLecture--\r\nProfessor Drinea is an okay lecturer. I had some trouble understanding her sometimes because of her accent and the fact that she is somewhat soft spoken. This was exacerbated by the horrible acoustics of the classroom (Mudd 833). That being said, she is quite good at explaining things, though you will need to review some content afterwards (as well as do some reading prior to lecture) to learn the maximum amount. All slides are posted on the course wiki.\r\n\r\nContent--\r\nWe covered a ton of content this semester (and according to my roommate, more than most Algorithms I classes cover). This included increased coverage in Linear Programming, P/NP Reductions, and a bit of Approximations. There was also a hackathon early in the semester that went over applications of various algorithms for those of you who are more programming focused.\r\n\r\nHomeworks--\r\n6 assignments that ranged from really easy (graph algorithm pset) to crazily difficult (dynamic programming pset). They are due every two weeks.\r\n\r\nExams--\r\nClosed book midterm and final. Midterm was incredibly long and difficult. Final was more reasonable length, but still pretty difficult. Averages were pretty low.\r\n\r\nOffice Hours--\r\nTA office hours are a mixed bag. Sometimes TAs don't know the answer to questions or have trouble explaining it. Being able to speak Chinese with them is actually a huge plus. Professor Drinea is very helpful in her office hours, so definitely go to her. On the whole, these are very important for succeeding in the class (unless you are absolutely brilliant).\r\n\r\nGrading--\r\nVery reasonable. I slacked the first half of class and finally picked up my game in the latter half (went to OHs and lecture). After all was said and done, my scores were a tick below the mean and I ended up with a B, so the curve appears to be the standard B/B+ for mean. ",

I would say Xi's a bit better than \"not bad\".\r\n\r\nTypically, classes like Algorithms go really fast, leaving most students lost and confused. Xi is good in this sense because he teaches at a slower pace so it's easier to understand the long proofs and sometimes dense material. The drawback of his speed is that we didn't finish the syllabus. We missed 2 classes because of snow days and another 3 classes because Xi was overly ambitious to cover so much material at his teaching pace. He also posts excellent slides online so you don't have to worry if you missed something in class.\r\n\r\nThe class itself is pretty hard. The book CLRS, while excellent, is quite dense and detailed. Homework was almost completely assigned from the exercises in the book, which are nearly impossible the solve. The HW averages were pretty high (around 55/60). This is because solutions to problems from CLRS are available online if you search carefully enough. I highly recommend you don't do this since you will get screwed come exam time. Xi is super helpful in Office Hours and you should go to him if you get stuck on HW (because you will, trust me). He will walk you through any problem and give you an outline of the solution. Sometimes, the problems are so hard, that Xi himself can't solve them on the spot (not knocking on Xi; he's really smart. I'm just saying the problems are that difficult). \r\n\r\nThe midterm was much easier than the problem sets, but still far from easy. One question on perfect hashing which worth 20 points could be solved only if you remembered a proof from his lecture slides. Most people didn't get it, so remember to read his slides thoroughly. Grading was fair, maybe a bit strict.\r\n\r\nFinal was similar to the midterm in difficulty and was a bit longer, but you had 3 hours which was plenty of time. I thought the final was easier, but I ended up getting a lower score on it than the midterm, so I don't know what to make of it.\r\n\r\nThe class had roughly 8 undergrads out of a 100 students, so be prepared to be lonely. There are PhD students in this class, so don't expect to ace it, though getting an A shouldn't be a problem if you put the effort into this class. I'm not sure if he curves undergrads separately.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a good class. You will learn a lot and become much better at constructing solid proofs and thinking algorithmically. I think Xi is just as good as Stein, so feel free to take this class with him.",

                "content": "I agree with the previous reviewer on almost every account.  I just want to elaborate on how some of the administrative details.  I ultimately really enjoyed the course and learned a ton.  That being said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hesitant to recommend it to anyone who is taking it just because someone told them it might be a good idea.  The workload is too heavy to undertake the course out of casual interest.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with an enormous class size, the course had a heavy focus on evaluation without much benefit.  The class had all the symptoms of a cash cow class for the master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program.  For the whole semester (except on days when homework was due), there were students filling every seat plus the stairs of the room.  The first time homework was handed back at the front of NWCB 501, the entire class fought like idiots around the tables to get their papers as quickly as possible.  Eventually, I realized that getting my homework back was pointless, as each problem rarely had any information other than the score I got on the problem.  If the score was something in between full score and no credit, they often wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother to underline or cross out the mistake.  This is a great way to give grades really quickly, but not much else.  These problems extended to both the assignments and the exams.\r\n\r\nThe professor gave a speech on the first day about the academic honesty policy, and how using the internet to help us with the homework is not allowed.  He said that violations would be treated harshly, and that there are no exceptions this policy.  He even implemented a policy to encourage us not to waste time writing anything for problems we did not know how to solve, which was to award 3 points out of 10 for leaving the problem blank.  That all seemed fine on the first day, until you realized that nobody gave a fuck and they were all just gunning for perfect scores, regardless of how they attained them.  The bottom line is that any incentives to prevent cheating were completely unsuccessful.  Yes, people who were honest were inevitably penalized. \r\n\r\nThe fact that such excessive amounts of this took place makes me question whether the expectations for the class were unreasonable.  I think most people thought to some extent that the workload was too heavy.  I think the workload did detract from learning for many students.  Yes, this is a class where doing the homework requires significant insight beyond what is presented in the lectures; this is a good thing to a certain extent but sometimes it went overboard.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the exams didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily do a good job normalizing for who was most sincere in their homework assignments.  I've been in classes before where people who cheated on the homework got killed on the exams; this was not one of those classes.  The main reason for this was that the midterm was take home (and obviously everyone collaborated).  This exam was a great deal easier than the homework assignments, but the expectations are generally a rather unclear, and the grading was much harsher than homework assignments.  Also, many of the more difficult theoretical problems did not really have anything to do with the exams.  Basically, the problem sets were so extensive that the exams weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t representative of how well students understood the assignments.  For example, much of the beginning of the course and the first two homework assignments are devoted to developing mathematical techniques, but none of this comes out on the exam.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think there should be some coordination between this class and data structures.  To put it bluntly, data structures here is a complete joke.  I think every undergrad in the class could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve benefitted from some attention to the more advanced data structures.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying this because the background was necessary or even helpful for the material we covered.",

Some of the problems were really great and I enjoyed working through a lot of them, but it definitely was excessive.\r\n\r\n35% Take home midterm - This was 3 problems that was generally easier than the problems on homework assignments, but some of the expectations were very unclear.  For example, when we were told to give an efficient algorithm, there was one case where the most efficient algorithm was Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covered Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm yet and it was on the syllabus for a later date.  That being said, I think every CS major knows about Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  The truth (according to the solutions) was we were expected to use a less efficient algorithm than Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm because it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been covered.  These types of ambiguities weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a factor in the homework assignments because they usually indicated the runtime of the algorithm we were supposed to devise.  Also (perhaps due to unclear expectations) the grading was harsh.  The average was a 45/60 and the median was a 47/60.  \r\n\r\n35% In-Class Final - A bit of a crapshoot, and completely impossible to prepare for.  The average was a 39/60, unsurprisingly the lowest average of the semester because it was the only in class exam.  The problem with the exams wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that they were unfair so much as if you made one wrong assumption about a problem, this made it incredibly easy to mess up.  "

Watch one lecture given by Stein on CVN and you will be inspired .. and sit for one lecture with this guy, and you will forget the little you knew before the class. His homeworks concentrate more on proving correctness than on designing algorithms and mapping problems to standard algorithms. It is a pity that a researcher of his caliber, does not have the ability or the inclination to make this class interesting. Believe me, you would be better off watching lectures on MIT OCW or stein's on CVN. You have been warned. ",

Also due to these experiences, I get pretty accustomed to learning by myself via notes from class (or textbooks). So given these, I still feel the class is a relatively hard one.\nProfessor Henry: Absolute nice and approachable. I believe he is the only professor currently specializing in quantum computing (a lot of big names probably also research on these, but I guess it's not a thing in their times and they don't do courses on his.) He is knowledgeable about the field, but perhaps due to his age and also the online format, I guess the lectures can be somewhat unstructured. Also, I believe he has never taught the topic to an undergraduate class, so he might have a slight over-expectation for this class.\nLectures: Amazing and exciting! Quantum computing is so different from classical computing that you will feel like you are studying the frontier of science, and indeed we learn about all basic quantum computing stuff you probably heard from pop-science articles (Shor's prime factoring, Grover search, quantum teleportation...), rigorously. The downside is the materials are quite dense and I can imagine many students will feel a but overwhelmed (plus a bit unstructured mentioned above). I believe the class will get even better when you guys take it given Henry will get more experienced\nPsets: there are only six psets (a pset0 for entry test and 5 normal psets) with no exams (originally the final exam is an additional pset but canceled). They are on average quite long, and one or two of them are quite hard (need to think hard). Many questions correspond to derivations that we don't have time to go over in class, which I like. Many other questions map to research papers in the field (I guess important/foundational ones) as an extension to the class material. Professor tries to guide us through the process in the psets, but they can be still quite hard (even when I find the corresponding papers) and take some time. But overall, I like them and I think they are very informative, useful, and fun. Like the lectures, I believe the psets will get updated and become much more manageable and even more fun.\nOverall: hard class(for CS students who haven't done a lot of theoretical classes), but very fun. Plus, I believe it will get even better in the future.",

He's the professor who looks over your shoulder while you're taking the midterm and tells you where you've made a mistake. (This boosted my score by at least 10 points.) He's the professor who absolutely glows when people do well on the homework. When he says his door is open, he _means_ it. Really means it.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not going to shit on him because I don't like him. Or because my grade will probably suck, because that's my fault for losing interest and not doing the work past March or so. I'm going to shit on him because despite what a wonderful person he is, his teaching has thoroughly earned it. Before I launch into that, though, here's my recommendation if you want to learn about quantum computing: read Scott Aaronson's book, \"Quantum Computing Since Democritus\". I bought it and chipped away at it half-heartedly for a few days in February and it taught me more and explained things better than Papageorgiou did in a whole semester.\r\n\r\nOk, now that we've got preliminaries out of the way:\r\n\r\nThe class really is as close to an out-and-out waste of time as I've had at Columbia. Each lecture starts with a 10-30 minute review of the previous lecture (generally closer to 10 minutes, but 30 happened a few times), so you're getting maybe 2/3 of a lecture. And then during that 2/3 of a lecture, the class covers very little material. For a sense of how little: it would be generous to say we covered 1.5 chapters of the textbook during the second half of the semester. And we only managed that by skipping all the tough material and glossing over the particulars of a lot of the easier material.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this isn't an \"easy\" class the way some with little content are. There's just a lot of time dedicated to intense study of trivia. A personal pet peeve: an inordinate amount of time was spent on how single qubit quantum gates can be decomposed into rotations. The textbook devotes maybe 10 lines to this, tucked away as a side note in the end-of-section exercises of an introductory chapter, but we dedicated many hours in class to example after example of this decomposition. One of the five questions on the final was decomposing a single qubit gate into rotations. And it came up during the final review. And on the quiz before the midterm. Papageorgiou kept coming back to it, guessing his way through the decomposition, explaining how he intuited every step, filling the whiteboard up top to bottom... all for a decomposition that can be solved quickly and directly by the algebraic substitution techniques you learned in middle school.\r\n\r\nWhile that's an extreme case, it's gives a sense of how the class worked and why we got almost nothing done. Papageorgiou can't seem to explain the \"big picture\" -- he drills down into particulars very quickly, and gets lost in them. There are professors who, at the beginning of a lecture, can tell you what you will learn today and what its place is in the course. Papageorgious can only do the former. As a result, at the end of the semester, the material you know is a fair  approximation to what you might know if you lifted 30 random paragraphs out of the first 4 chapters of the textbook and then studied each intensively for an hour. You'd know plenty of factoids but have little grasp of how they fit together. My working hypothesis: Papageorgiou never sat down and worked out a theory of what this class is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nAgain, an example, which I think is representative: a physics major in our class was confused by the proof that sets of quantum gates are universal. He objected that the proof didn't address the efficiency of constructing an arbitrary gate from the universal set. Flustered, Papageorgiou brushed this off, saying roughly \"In quantum computing, we don't care about efficiency!\" That might make sense if there weren't so much fuss about the efficiency of Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The \"big picture\" explanation that was never forthcoming: quantum computing, like the deterministic variety, happened as a progression from proofs of computability (in this case, universality of gates) to proofs of efficient algorithms for specific problems (e.g. Shor) to...\r\n\r\nAh. Another sore point. We never got the next step, \"proofs that quantum computing algorithms form families,\" the quantum complexity classes. The book, which is 15 years old, barely knows quantum complexity classes exist. But they do, and what I've read about them on my own (e.g. Aaronson's book, Wikipedia) is really really cool, and it was very disappointing and frustrating to go through a whole semester and not (as far as I can recall) hear BQP mentioned even once.\r\n\r\nOk, I'm going to stop now because you've probably gotten the point. :P",

But it was not a joke: it covered a reasonable amount of material in a reasonable amount of depth. Papageorgiou is just an effective teacher, and he doesn't assign cruel problem sets.\r\n\r\nThe class covers only the basics of quantum computing. It's a CS class but it would be reasonable for a physics major to take it, if they had some very rudimentary CS knowledge (logic circuits, and the general idea of big-O analysis of runtimes). The fact that it was targeted at two groups limited the material we could cover. We couldn't really talk about complexity theory to avoid alienating the physics majors. And we couldn't talk about any actual quantum mechanics or real-world implementations of quantum computers, because that would have terrified the CS majors.\r\n\r\nYou definitely need to know your linear algebra coming in. The first quarter of the class is basically linear algebra review, to familiarize students with the Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics, and help them get used to working with complex numbers. We then worked through how operations on quantum states can be equivalent to Boolean circuits (proving that quantum computers are at least as powerful as classical computers).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the class was going over the famous quantum algorithms that are better than any known classical algorithm. Shor's factoring algorithm, which is the cool thing that everyone wants to learn, didn't really come in until the last few weeks of class (although much of the groundwork was laid before that).\r\n\r\nLectures were basically the professor working through problems on a digital board and explaining as he went. It was important to take good notes, because for some reason he would not post copies of these digital notes online. His lectures were quite helpful; they followed the general structure of the textbook but made explicit some parts of the book left \"as an exercise to the reader\". Normally I think this format is terrible, but there was something mysterious going on and I actually remembered most of what I learned. Perhaps it was the professor's mellifluous accent.\r\n\r\nThe professor and TA were both helpful and available during office hours. They were also both responsive by email, and generally very friendly in all their interactions.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great class. I didn't have to work that hard and I still learned a ton. It's the best of all possible worlds.",

It served as a nice opportunity to learn concepts and strategies that serve as a basis for artificial intelligence and gradually transition to working with actual AI technology. The balance between coding and conceptual assignments also served as a way of putting these concepts we learned in lecture into practice (though they got a bit tedious at times).

                "workload": "The class had 5 coding assignments and 5 conceptual assignments (50% total), and two exams throughout the semester (25%) that effectively served as \u201cmidterms\u201d without any final when I took it. To my knowledge, this setup doesn\u2019t apply anymore and the second exam had gotten pushed to later on in the semester and became a final. The assignments were staggered such that the conceptual assignment was always due before the accompanying coding assignment. The lowest coding and conceptual grades also got dropped at the time. The conceptual assignments involve calculations, short-answer, etc. related to the topics we went through for the course, while the coding assignments involved applying these concepts for Python code. The assignments we did were:\n* comparing search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc.) for number sliding puzzles\n* backtracking with optimization for solving sudoku puzzles \n* minimax for deciding a move for 2048\n* using a neural network for sign language sign classification\n* a 5th assignment that I unfortunately don\u2019t have the file for at the moment as I skipped it (my apologies)\n\nThese assignments get reused between semesters, and I would say the 2048 algorithm was the most difficult, as it involved testing out different values as part of functions that you need to implement. The sudoku and number-sliding puzzles were the second-hardest, then the neural network one was the easiest out of the four I completed for the class. The exams, however, were pretty rough. I was able to do decently on the first with moderate studying for it, but I admittedly did much worse on the second since I couldn\u2019t finish. However, the course gets curved accordingly, and these exams take up relatively low weight compared to other classes. To that end, the work is a lot more doable to be able to get an A compared to Prof. Dear, as well as other CS classes in the department \u2013 do what you will with that information\u2026"

Dear is honestly un-avoidable in the CS department because he carries so much of it with Discrete, AI, and CLA and I just don't think his teaching style works for me. Lectures are well-organized (positive) but formulaic to the point where it's just so amazingly boring. An uncharismatic, dry CS lecturer isn't a big deal if the homeworks are interesting/make sense. Yeah......no. In this class, homeworks always felt as they were written to punish and trick students, not actually get them to understand the material or find it any more interesting. I spent more time trying to figure out what the questions were even asking than solving the questions themselves. Exams were demoralizing, and felt harder than the practice exams. At least with CLA he curved generously though so we'll see.\nI know you need to walk before you can run, and that's probably the reason behind keeping everything so abstract and theoretical. But one little taste of how AI can be actually cool to work with/build projects with would be nice. Maybe that's the big brain point of the class? If you're not super into the math and getting tricked on homeworks then AI isn't for you?",

If this does not match your learning style, you will probably feel like you're wasting your time. Because there is so much hand-holding involved, it's easy to score well without doing all that much work. That said, I think this course is a great introductory course for non-majors or people just starting CS.\nMaterial--very broad overview of AI and high-level discussions of concepts. To get a sense of what the book is like, you can just check out the Wikipedia page on \"Artificial Intelligence\" or any of the topics on the syllabus. You will not find much more depth in 4701.\nQuizzes--the quizzes are mostly multiple choice and it's all open book. Extra study time generally is not rewarded as there's not that much depth involved. Also, expect some wrong multiple choice answers to be adversarial in nature so be prepared to second guess your response all the time.\nHomework--About 75-80% of the code is written all ready, and the remaining code is not difficult to implement. Most of it was translating pseudocode into python. The short answer responses were also not terribly interesting. \"Is this implementation more efficient than the other\", \"Is this guaranteed to find a solution\", etc.\nGrading--There is a curve, but it's probably not necessary since everyone is scoring in the 80s and 90s. The grading rubric is well defined and expectations for each assignment/quiz are clear. \nI would recommend this course to people without a background in CS or math.

His lecture notes are helpful, and as a person who avoids reading the textbook, I found that convenient when reviewing for exams. Bauer does have a German accent but I don't think it is difficult to understand. Although he explains concepts well and respects questions, his lectures can sometimes be a little boring to follow. But if you're willing to pay attention, you will learn enough to do well in the class. He tries to get students excited about AI & ML --there was a simple ML assignment in 1006, and assigned readings in the AI HWs. HW prompts are so detailed to the point where all you need to do is implement it in Python, and exams are straightforward so in terms of difficulty, it's not hard to succeed in his class.\r\n\r\n1006 is a required class for many, but whether or not to take AI is a question to consider. Whether you take it with Ansaf or Bauer, the class itself doesn't go very in depth in AI. It's a nice intro and a good class to tack onto some other CS workload--teaches some game theory, deep learning, and a little stats stuff. I had fun but if you're genuinely interested in AI, just go have a conversation with Bauer. Whatever you choose, good luck in your CS career!\r\n\r\nOverall, I do recommend Bauer and hope to see him improve as a lecturer.",

She was incredibly personable, and always had time during her office hours to help or chat. \r\n\r\nSo...I didn't think this was a good class. I know a lot of seniors took this class because it was supposed to be relatively easy where you still learned a lot. Unfortunately, neither of those were true this semester. This could be because this is the first time in two years that this course has been offered, or perhaps because she (very nicely) expanded the class to 275 students, so there was less one-on-one time with instructors. As it was, the Professor would show up late (despite her best efforts) every class because of a meeting directly prior to class. That's unfortunate, because it means the first 5-15min of class were used for setting up instead of lecturing. I think if the Professor knew she would be teaching a class at 1:10pm, she should have scheduled her meeting for another time (or vice versa). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the class was incredibly disorganized. The homework instructions were generally incredibly vague and because of that on Piazza there would be -- I kid you not -- 50-80 unanswered piazza posts during homework times. The homeworks were also badly managed, as they were more rushed in deadlines towards the end of the semester. Also, there was a time where a homework was due the same time as the midterm, which was incredibly distracting and in my opinion badly managed. Considering how much time the homeworks took, it was relatively disorganized schedule-wise.\r\n\r\nThe exams weren't much better - instead of testing the actual content of the class slides/lectures, they tested your speed in problem solving. If you're able to do each problem in about a minute to 5 minutes you'll be fine -- but that was not typical. If you take the exams, I recommend that you first focus on the highest weighted problems first -- aim for the max points in the least time, not about going in depth. The practice problems are good for general formatting, but not on timing. If the professor had added more practice problems for exams I think that would have helped. \r\n\r\nFinally, the TAs were generally useless. Of the about 10 TA's, all of whose office hours I went to, only about 3 were consistently able to answer my questions and help me on my homeworks. Jimmy/Ruicong was the best TA so I hope he stays on if this class gets taught again. \r\n\r\nIn general, I wouldn't take this class again. I didn't feel like I learned anything, and the homeworks were just implementing algorithms in a really convoluted way. ",

Full disclosure: I got an A in this class, so this isn't just whining.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ansaf is super nice but incredibly disorganized. She never showed up to class on time, and every class had \"technical issues\" that would last the first 15 minutes of lecture time. Furthermore, when she would teach, it would be rushed and very high level, when what you needed to know on the exams and homework were much more detailed. Again because of her disorganization, the first half of the class was very laid back - there was very little work and only two homeworks. Then, for some godforsaken reason she decided to assign homework 3 (the 2048 game, in my opinion, the hardest homework because of the necessary optimization problems) and have the midterm two days apart. It was endless sleepless nights because the homework took so goddam long and so did studying for the midterm. Her practice exam was only slightly helpful, and neither were her lectures for the midterm.\r\n\r\nSide note: her exams don't test knowledge. They test speed. The midterm exam was absolutely ridiculous because it had about twice as many questions as were possible to answer in that time period. It was super frustrating, especially since none of the students knew that coming in, so a lot of people absolutely bombed that exam when we actually knew the content. When I went to talk to her about it, she said she wasn't going to help because everyone was graded on a curve. Okay, thanks for that nonexistent help. \r\n\r\nFinally, the last half of the class was incredibly rushed, because she realized she hadn't taught any of the topics she needed for the homeworks. So instead of giving us time for the assignments by spacing them out, she instead gave us an assignment every week. The homeworks are incredibly time-consuming (because you always have to optimize over and over again) so you barely had any time at the end of the semester to do anything. Finally, the final again was ridiculous. \r\n\r\nAll I can say is that I hated this class. Professor Ansaf was disorganized and there were only 1 or 2 TAs that were actually helpful. In essence, take this class only if you're prepared to learn everything on your own, and get no support from the professor besides a curve. ",

There was a good balance of traditional AI topics such as agents, search algorithms, CSPs and logic with a focus on machine learning in the second half of the semester. The prof mainly used her slides but there were some chalk board sessions as well. The slides were very well prepared and Prof Ansaf takes you through the math in a very simplified manner. The slides are sufficient and the text book can be used for any reference reading.\r\n\r\nThere were four assignments and all of them had Python programming. Basic programming knowledge is sufficient for this class as Python is easy to pick up. There was a Python recitation taken by one of the TAs in the beginning of the semester and it was very helpful to get started. The assignments were interesting (application of AI to games like 2048, mazes etc) but time consuming - as you can keep trying to improve the performance of your program. Definitely the best way to understand the intricacies of the algorithm though and the prof was kind enough to give additional time on the assignments when required. There were a lot of opportunities to score extra credit if you needed to catch up on a bad performance. We had one quiz and a lot of suggested reading material if you were interested. The course covered a lot of topics - AI and ML related. But the midterm and final were both open notes so you could focus on application rather than memorizing formulae or algorithms. The exams definitely made you think but as long as you understood the content it, the problems were solvable. The final grading formula was very generous and took the best performances into account for most students.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were helpful during office hours and on Piazza. Especially close to exam time, the response time of the prof on Piazza was great which helped a lot.\r\n\r\nThe professor balanced heavy course material with lighter \"historical moments of the day\" and current events in AI which made the two and a half hour class easier to get through. We also had a guest lecturer in the last class. All in all the professor really cared and took great initiative to give us more information than strictly the course content and made the classes more fun.",

                "content": "I took this AI class with Ansaf. I like her teaching style and her class. She focus on the searching algorithm and machine learning for most time which are quite interesting to me. It is not easy to cover all the machine learning algorithms in less than half semester so that she taught a little bit fast in the machine learning part. The after class studying will be necessary if you want to grasp these algorithms. I also like her homework. She have assigned four homework, all programming in python. Most of them are very practical problem(for example to program a AI for 2048 game) and some of them are very challenging. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to say the importance of this class to me. Honestly I expect more in this class because firstly I have taken machine learning before and I want to have a systemic understanding about how to build up an AI. But after taken this class, what I have learn and what I can understanding is not clear enough. I cannot say that I have a clearly and systemic understanding about how to build up a practical AI. Maybe it is because the artificial intelligence is a quite wild field that cannot be cover by only one class in one semester. If I can arrange the topics in this class, I will set this class as a higher level class and the machine learning class should be required before this class. Then the professor may discuss more in AI rather than take most of time to discuss machine learning and algorithm. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Ansaf is a quite instructive teacher. For those students who haven't taken machine learning before, this class is very useful and you can learn a lot in this class.\r\n\r\n(written by Z.H.)",

We literally spent 60% of the class studying logic of some sort. I would rather have learned more about search algorithms and machine learning. Radev coached the International Linguistics Olympiad team so he's a big fan of linguistics and it shows in his teaching. He spent a lot of time talking about gramamars and outlining NLP at a highly impractical level which I really hated. I think you can learn more about AI by taking a MOOC online from Coursera or Udacity.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 programming projects which are all very time consuming. He gives you 2 weeks for each and they take at least 6-8 hrs. There's no upper limit since you can improve the assignments as much as you want in an effort to get the very generous extra credit (up to 20 points on a 100 point assignment that counts for 20% of your grade). Only 2 of the projects had anything to do with AI. The first one was to be coded in LISP which has the dumbest syntax ever - it's like a poor man's Haskell with a lot of parenthesis.\r\n\r\nAll in all, can't recommend taking this class since it doesn't really cover much. Radev's a nice guy and probably the best teacher for AI you're going to find but the class itself is pointless.\r\n\r\nTests are ok. If you read all the slides you should be fine. If you understand all the algorithms and definitions, you'll do great - there aren't any questions that require a lot of thinking and being clever. He just test how well you know the material. Be warned that some of the slides kind of stink in which case you might want to refer the textbook. Don't waste time reading the entire textbook like he asks you to - it's just a scape goat for him to ask you anything he wants and for you to not complain that it wasn't covered.\r\n\r\nGrading was decently generous.

                "content": "The rest of the reviews are pretty accurate about this class but I figured I should add in a bit to just explain Prof. Voris. Let me start by saying Prof. Voris is a terrible human being and might be one of the worst people I have ever met. He would often belittle students for asking questions related to class material or about class policies. His assignments were based off what we learned in class with the majority of the difficulty coming from the insane amount of fluff put on top of them. Like he gave us games to encode a solver for and I must have spent 1% of the time on the solving algorithm (the important part of the assignment relevant to the class) and 99% of the time dealing with the absurdly detailed rules of the game that had no reason to exist beside to waste our times. Now back to the real problem Voris. Every time a student asked him for something, like if he could post the blank midterm online after we got it back so we can study it for the final, he would answer in the most demeaning way ever. Every question he felt was a personal attack on himself. Now I am by no means a psych major, but I would say he had a huge fear of being seen as inferior. He would oftentimes go on rants about how in his college, which is some local school that most people have never heard of, he had it so much harder and how Columbia students were entitled and a bunch of cheaters. This rant about how much harder he had it occurred so many times and he would constantly belittle Columbia students as a whole. He clearly was trying to somehow prove his superiority to a bunch of kids who never saw him as inferior in anyway. All I can say is that he has some deep issues and probably would be better suited to teaching at a community college where he does not find the need to always defend himself even if the students are not attacking him. My favorite example of him being an ass if when he was trying to hand out the midterms and basically put them all in one giant pile in the front and told the students to come get it. Of course everyone got up and was gathered around the table. Now what does Voris say? He starts repeatedly yelling (for like 10 minutes straight) \"You all are animals and you should be ashamed of yourselves! I never saw this when I was in school\". He clearly has no idea what he is doing and I hear Columbia is looking to hire a real AI teacher (Voris can't teach very well either so this is a good thing) so hopefully he will never teach a class again. But Voris if you are reading this please go see a Psychologist you have some issues that need to be worked out. ",

AI is supposed to be a fun class, and there are plenty of interesting topics that can be covered in a semester long course. However, at the end of the semester, you would find what you had learned was just a bunch of search algorithms plus some machinery that helps you play with logic expressions. I think if Professor Voris had spent less time(or none at all) on giving pop quizzes, explaining the solutions to the pop quizzes and reiterating some of the petty uninteresting concepts, he would probably have had time to cover some more interesting and important topics such as  reinforcement learning and applications of AI in robotics/vision/nlp, etc. But I gotta say this is the first time Professor Voris have taught the course and he did try to teach the course as best he could.

                "content": "Jonathan Voris was hands down the worst professor I've had in the Computer Science department (although I suppose I use the term 'professor' lightly here, because I believe he was a post-doc who was teaching Artificial Intelligence for the first time), and among the top 3 worst professors I've had at Columbia (which is surprising since he speaks perfect English).\r\n\r\nThe Good:\r\nThe first day, I was rather excited to be taking this course, because Artificial Intelligence is a subject of great interest to me, and I was pleased to find that Dr. Voris was very enthusiastic about the subject matter, and the first three introductory lectures, while sometimes rambling, were at least engaging. \r\n\r\nThe Bad:\r\nUnfortunately it was all down hill from there: it became incredibly difficult to determine what information from lectures was relevant. As a result more than half of the class stopped attending lectures (Voris began giving pop quizzes in class around 3/4's of the way through the semester).\r\n\r\nThe Ugly:\r\nProgramming Assignments: The programming assignments were long. I mean incredibly long. The assignments consisted of single page pdf files describing a task in vague detail. There were no suggestions for completion strategies (fine, you don't get these in real life) but more frustratingly, there was absolutely no framework given. The projects often required large amounts of infrastructure (e.g. coding of 5 search algorithms) before any part of the conceptually interesting portion of the assignment could be tackled (algorithm design, heuristic/evaluation functions). Voris was a hard-ass about deadlines, which is reasonable, although perhaps less reasonable was his choice to assign the 4th project and the in class final due 4 days apart. \r\n\r\nExams: The material on the exams was not very difficult, however the exams themselves were incredibly confusing. The midterm was almost as if he had never before written an exam, for practically every question it was difficult to tell even what the question was asking. On top of this, the TA's couldn't answer questions because only 1 of them could speak reasonable english, and the Professor refused to answer questions because he might give away the answer. The final was in class on the last day, and the questions were more clear, however the exam itself was pretty long and somewhat tedious in nature.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous: The professor, in my opinion, had a patronizing tone throughout the class and routinely treated students as if they were stupid. On top of that he did very little listening and a whole lot of talking when students expressed their concerns. No review or example materials were provided for any assignments or tests. And, more of an annoyance compared to the rest of what was going on, the Professor would often engage in pointless discussions (read: arguments) with students about a very specific point of no importance that would last for 10-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nJonathan Voris is clearly knowledgeable and passionate about Computer Science, but in no way qualified to teach this course.\r\n\r\nOne Caveat: I don't know how much he changed the material from Professor Stalfo's version of the course. It is possible that the assignments and lecture notes were entirely the same. This does not change the fact that Voris was an insufferable asshole, who seemingly refused to listen to his students and insisted on wasting class time on pointless and pedantic arguments with students.\r\n\r\ntl dr: Course was horrible, Professor was horrible. If you value your time and sanity I recommend you steer clear (although I don't know if it is being offered again, so it's probably a moo point.) I give this course a 1/10.",

Unfortunately, he failed to meet expectations.\r\n\r\nVoris is a very nice guy, but was disorganized during his lectures.  Also his command of Common Lisp wasn't the greatest, and used code from Stack Overflow in his slides.  Thankfully, he only required Lisp for the first assignment.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were a little much.  I found that I was working on the implementation more than the actual search algorithms.  I spent weeks working on the game implementation for Gomoku and Sokobon, while rushing through the search algorithms hours before the assignments were due.  Also, he provides the easiest test cases possible, while using hard ones to grade.  Most of my assignments assignments passed all of the test cases, but I ended up doing poorly on them because the test cases used for grading were not even remotely as easy as the examples he provided.\r\n\r\nThe reviews from Stolfo's class mostly say that he skims over everything interesting in AI.  Voris wasn't much different, and we actually covered less material than Stolfo usually does.  We didn't even get to machine learning, and our last assignment was on logic, entailment via forward and backward chaining (which I thought was an extremely boring project that again, takes more time to write the implementation than the search algorithms).\r\n\r\nThe midterm was fair, but the final was rough.  Voris said that chapters 1-9 would be on the final, yet he ended up testing us on topics mostly before the midterm.  We did not receive any sample questions or past exams, and were unsure of what to expect on the exams.  I though the final was way to long, and Voris said he had planned to make it even longer.\r\n\r\nWe used Piazza as our forum for discussion and questions outside of class.  To be fair, some students did ask questions that could have been easily answered from a quick google search.  But that doesn't mean the instructor should respond to them in a sarcastic and demeaning way.  Some of Voris' answers to Piazza questions were very defensive and sarcastic, including \"Uhh, you can run Eclipse on the clic lab machines?\" or \"I only posted the text file with puzzles because people complained I didn't post any examples\" and \"Guys, I've already made it rather clear that all of the material in the book chapters that we've covered is fair game.\"  He also would write something like \"please see me in office hours if this is unclear\" rather than post a response.\r\n\r\nBasically all the course material (lecture slides, etc.) was given to him by Stolfo.  There were mistakes in the slides, and he usually correctly them quickly.  Although I did hear him arguing with a student about ambiguity in a final exam question and Voris' response was something like \"[Stolfo] has been using these slides for 20 years and I don't think he had this much trouble with grade arguments.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, I guess Voris was a better choice than Stolfo, but if you aren't required to take this class, I suggest avoiding it like the plague.  At least Voris made the tournament extra credit, and all who participated earned at least 5 extra credit points, even if they lost in the first round.",

I'm pretty sure he was roped into teaching the class right before the semester started, if that's worth anything when considering this review.\r\n\r\nQuick Summary:\r\nGood lectures (if a bit dry; depends on your taste)\r\nRanges from very approachable to completely unapproachable\r\nDoes not deal well with grades.  \r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Voris was a good, solid teacher.  He taught the material well, and was mostly light-hearted about the material.  He really seemed to enjoy the class when he took it (7 years ago I think), and he definitely transferred that joy over to teaching it this time around.  I liked his lectures, though sometimes they were a bit dry (often the material was at fault).  Basically, Voris is a good teacher.\r\n\r\nHowever, Prof. Voris comes with a special type of schtick.  The best approximation of an explanation of it is a mix of ego and paranoia.  When it comes to grades, he seems paranoid that every student is willing to kill him if that will give them a better grade.  This is not (much) of an exaggeration; he really is paranoid about this.  When it comes to anything involving grades, simple questions offend him like the deepest of insults, and he is completely unreasonable.  When handing out the midterm, after failing to get students to come up in an alphabetical order, he just dropped all the tests on the table, and sat back, calling the students \"animals\" and \"disgusting\" while everyone searched through the mess to get their tests.  Not cool.\r\n\r\nAlso, if he can't understand a question, he often assumes that the question is stupid, and sometimes even worthy of mockery.  He will always try to explain a question once, but if the explanation is not sufficient for the student, and he thinks that it was, he will make comments like \"I don't understand what's not to get.\" or \"This is pretty simple.\"  He is in desperate need of learning the phrase \"Why don't you come see me after class?  I'll explain it then- we should move on\".\r\nThis ambiguity often translates to the workload- the projects were good, but the formatting was often unclear.  Tiny details that made actually finishing the damn things a nightmare.  To be fair, many students just seemed to ignore what was actually written in the project assignments in regards to submission details (\"Must run on a CLIC machine\" seemed to be an oft ignored instruction for many students).  All in all though, the details just needed to be crystal clear, and they weren't.\r\n\r\nHis midterm and finals were VERY reasonable.  However, the grading of them weren't.  He hasn't posted our final grades, so it is unknown whether he will curve or not, but some of the ways he took off points were pointless.  The purpose of a test is to test our knowledge of the material, not our ability to decipher certain cryptic instructions.  The questions were good- they were actually really good tests.  But, like I said, the grading was off.\r\n\r\nAll in all, he was good for learning the material, and terrible for anything to do with grades.  Just a bit of a nightmare to deal with the schtick.  Not a bad person, just not adjusted to teaching (yet).  If he shapes up on the grading thing though, he could definitely be a really great prof. in the future!",

Out of a class of 100+, only a handful of students even bothered showing up towards the end. \r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem if we had a remote idea of what material we were responsible for knowing. We were given literally zero resources to prepare for the exams - no sample exam, no list of topics review, not even chapters in the book that would be covered. Multiple questions posted on Piazza about the scope of the exam were left unanswered. This is after not having a single written assignment for the entire course. There was exactly one programming assignment covering material from the second half of class, but it was due the week following the final exam, which is just bizarre.\r\n\r\nThe exams themselves are a frustrating joke - 40% of the material on the midterm came from 4 one-word answers (two yes/no), with no partial credit. Stolfo said this was because it made grading easier.\r\n\r\nIf you do wind up suffering through this course, I really hope you don't give a shit about your grade. The AI tournament is worth as much as the final exam, and involves students programming a game-playing intelligence and playing against each other. While it's a cool idea, 20% of your grade comes form how well your program does in the tournament. It's a single-elimination tournament. Meaning that it's possible to have the second-best program in the entire course, but if you get paired with the first-best program in the first round, -15 points for you (there's a five-point \"losers bonus\").\r\n\r\nNot only that, but half the class is grad students, and there aren't separate tournaments for grad students and undergrads. Meaning you could get paired up with a Ph D student who's been working on their algorithm for a month because it's the only class they're in. I don't know a single undergraduate who made it past the first round.\r\n\r\nI think the most frustrating part of this course is that all of the above concerns were brought to Stolfo's attention multiple times by multiple students - he seems to either not care or not listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Additionally, it should not have been required to learn LISP which wasted an additional 2 weeks at the beginning where we didn't learn any AI. He also cancelled a class at the end because he didn't have anything else to teach us. Overall, if you consider that he only used about 2/3 of the allotted class time, we had about 10 lectures on AI for the whole semester. How do courses at CMU, Stanford, MIT and Cornell manage to do fill a whole semester? \r\nAs stated in other reviews, all of his lectures are taken totally out of the book, except the knowledge representation lectures. In these lectures, rather than covering the interesting material on epistemic logic that the book had, he spent the entire time on algorithms for expert systems which haven't really been used since the 90s.\r\nHe also arbitrarily set his curve to a B-/C+ which would be fine except no other professor in the department does that.\r\nBasically Artificial Intelligence is an extremely interesting field and the fact that I am still interested in it despite Pasik is a testament to the material.

                "content": "If tl;dr, just scroll to bottom.\r\n\r\nOf the three CS classes I've taken so far at Columbia, this was hands down the worst of all of them. Prior to enrolling in the class, I read the reviews here on CULPA and figured that the people complaining about Pasik's teaching style and glossing over LISP and other concepts were simply whiners. It took me 3 lectures to completely reverse my initial opinion. Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not disgruntled because I did poorly in the class (even without the extra credit, I would've gotten an A). I'm bitter about enrolling in this class because it was nothing short of a waste of time and money.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the semester, I've come to realize that Pasik really doesn't put in that much effort into teaching. Here's why: of the 28 days that the class was scheduled to meet, 8 of them were committed to other activities (6 reviews, 2 exams). Of these review sessions, Pasik shows up to exactly one. While I thought the review session that he conducted was actually the best among all of them (probably because the subsequent reviews were horrific), he prepared no material and basically held an hour-long Q&A section. Moreover, he canceled one additional class, and ended at least 5 classes 20+ minutes early. So all-in-all, instead of using 28 days to teach, he effectively taught for roughly 18. The result of this is that we barely covered any material. A simple google search of Artificial Intelligence syllabi from top institutions like Stanford, CMU, MIT, etc, reveals that we covered about 1/3 of the material they did. And that's a generous estimate. I have one word for that: pathetic.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of Pasik's teaching that many of my classmates found irritating was the fact that he read directly off of his slides. In the past during my undergrad years, and even this past semester, I've had professors that used PowerPoint slides extensively. Sometimes, they even read off of the slides verbatim just like Pasik. This I have no problem with. What annoyed me the most was the dearth of content in those slides and how cryptic most of them were. This can be especially frustrating when some of the material he presents is not covered in the book, and the only source of reference you have is a figure of a rectangle with a few splotches of color that's supposed to represent the effectiveness of parallelism.\r\n\r\nFinally, a feature of Pasik's teaching that I found to be ineffective and even counterproductive was his insistence on going over code in class. I think the main problem with this is that code in LISP is not readable. The task of keeping track of what all the different built-in functions in LISP do in addition to the user-defined functions Pasik writes results in students being confused as everything becomes just one huge convoluted mess. I think that the time spent in analyzing LISP code would be better spent if the algorithms were presented in pseudo-code (mostly in ENGLISH) rather than actual code. Since the course is comprised of mostly grad students, converting pseudo-code to LISP code should not be hard once the students actually understand what the program is supposed to do. \r\n\r\nIs Pasik a nice guy? I wouldn't know since he has no office hours and is only transiently available before and after class. I stopped emailing him questions shortly after term started since his responses are one-liners and don't really answer your more complicated questions. Maybe it's because he's involved in many other activities that doesn't give him time prepare and do the material justice. I get it, professors are busy people. But there's a line between being a busy person and simply not giving a damn.\r\n\r\nBottom line: if your main objective is to get an easy A, this course is the one for you. If you want to actually learn something, take a different class.",

Unfortunately his office hours are practically non-existent, but he's always around for about half an hour before class, and for as long as you need after.\r\n\r\nThe course was taught in LISP, but if you're not familiar with this language, don't worry. He usually spends some time at the beginning of the semester explaining the basics, and none of the assignments require any really advanced level knowledge of LISP. If you get stuck, you can almost always find what you need with a little Googling. \r\n\r\nHis lectures are interesting and if you show up consistently and take thorough notes, you may not even need the textbook. Be warned, you will hear lots of stories about him and his family's zany adventures, but he's a good story teller and there's always an AI related moral in the end.\r\n\r\nAs another person pointed out, there is a lot of discussion about the philosophy of AI, but if you look up, you'll see that the name of this class is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Artificial Intelligence Programming\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, it's just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Artificial Intelligence\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The history and theory of AI are relevant to the course, even if they're not all that relevant to the grade. There will be some readings on this and probably one question on one test somewhere. If you decide to skip it all together it won't kill you, but it is interesting and might even help you out a little on the homeworks.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are deceptively complex, but they're not very difficult once you figure out what you're supposed to be doing. Give yourself some time. You're not going to bang them out in one night, but you can get them done over the weekend if you don't have much else to do.\r\n\r\nThe tests are sort of cumulative. It's usually around 3/4 new material and 1/4 old material. Expect a coding question, usually just a variation of something from the homework. He expects you to know all the algorithms by name so be sure you've go that down.

The assignment descriptions sound straightforward and manageable, at first. It is when you start to work on it that you realize you know WHAT the homework means (that is all the lectures are good for), but not HOW to implement it. Most of the time will be spent figuring out how the program should work, even in a conceptual way, in order to achieve the algorithm that Pasik wants. \r\n\r\nThis is made harder because (a) You are using Lisp for probably the first time, a language that is not used anywhere outside academia and will never be useful to you again. No other language you have learned or lab you have taken in CS at Columbia will prepare you for understanding Lisp except the concept of recursion (b) You will not learn, during lectures, the Lisp you need to do the homework. After the first couple lectures, Pasik will not continue to teach Lisp and consider everyone a \"Lisp expert\" (c) You will spend hours reading Lisp primers before you actually work on the program. For this reason (and the fact that you have 3 other CS classes to worry about), the assignments will most likely lead to several all-nighters. Pasik has a 1-point-per hour deduction late policy, which is the most ridiculous policy I've ever come across in a CS class. If a student must resort to submit late, do you really think it will be by a couple hours? For a class like this, 25% deduction per day is much more reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are brief (usually they take Pasik 30 min to get through), with a focus on definitions instead of Lisp-based, example-driven concepts. Typically, a lecture will have one or two high-level examples (i.e. a diagram or graph), and one or two, if at all, slides of lisp code that do not relate to the homework in any way and will not be useful for exams.\r\n\r\nAs for the exams, I really didn't mind them. They are straightforward. However, each question is usually 1 point out of 10 points, so four points off already puts you at 60. Pasik will not tell you what questions will be on the exam. The best method is to read the slides carefully and focus on definitions. Also, there will be a lisp question on each exam that relates to the homework (i.e. a snippet of code from your hw).",

If anything, I'd say the exact opposite!  He would always take time to address questions, and would even work them out on the board if he didn't have the answer on the top of his head.  He was in *no way* dismissive of questions, and actually was looking for questions from the class more often than we had them.\r\n\r\nI can understand that some people might dislike his teaching style if they don't want to engage with him, but really, if you pay attention, you learn a lot and are entertained at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, as some people have mentioned, he really does like LISP and recursion.\r\n\r\nOverall, I definitely would recommend him, and I think he is deserving of a silver nugget.

Stolfo managed to make interesting material difficult to learn through his insufferable lecture style and frustrating programming assignments.  He rants and pontificates, only occasionally delivering actual content.  He seems to teach this class to have a captive audience for his jokes, which alternate between offensive and inane.  Many are posted on his website, reflecting his general unprofessionalism.  I found Stolfo so loathsome that I couldn't bring myself to go to lecture for the last month.  When I tried to watch the lectures online (they were all posted because the class is offered to CVN students) I couldn't watch for more than 20 minutes.  He started one class sulking because the 15 people who still attended class were not being responsive enough to a series of vague/inane questions.  He tries to put on a dramatic and inspiring performance (like Gulati perhaps) but since he utterly lacks charisma the result is grating.  For example, he asked the class on numerous occasions, \"do you remember when you first touched a stove and learned what hot means?  do you remember? do you?\"  He would keep this up until someone pretended like he or she had a memory of this exact experience.  To most, this would seem like a rhetorical question but he wouldn't stop until he received confirmation that this very same scenario had happened to each of us.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were almost entirely composed of trick questions rather than straightforward questions about material that we had actually learned.  I think they were supposed to be easy but I didn't understand what they were asking.  Since I got around the mean grade on each, it seems like most of the class was similarly bewildered.\r\n\r\nStolfo's approach to teaching Lisp was to reminisce about the early days of computer science when it was just an elite group and make us fix buggy code.  While the programming assignments were ultimately the only worthwhile part of the class, I think they could have been less frustrating while still teaching the same important lessons.  After being exposed to Lisp for 50+ hours, I felt like I had learned how to conquer it and work around its structure rather than actually feeling comfortable.  While Stolfo's introduction to the language was certainly inadequate, Lisp is basically just a frustrating language.\r\n\r\nIf you can tolerate these jokes (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sal/notes/y13.html) or find them amusing then take the class with Stolfo.

He's an engaging, funny lecturer, the material is interesting, and the homework is a genuine pleasure to code. \r\n\r\nMost of the time, though, he doesn't teach it properly. Stolfo seems to have gotten it into his head that AI ought to be conducted like a Socratic seminar; as a consequence, you will spend most of your time in this class in awkward silence people do their best to avoid making eye contact. To make matters worse, he has a particularly nasty tendency towards extreme vagueness, so his questions tend to be things like \"so what is it about this problem?\" or even \"what was the thing that you learned during the first half of the course?\". That may fly CC, but in a computer science class (and particularly one requiring an above-average level of formal rigor) it's hard to imagine a less effective teaching style.\r\n\r\nThe real problem here is that because nobody answers his questions, the lectures creep ahead very slowly, and class falls further and further behind schedule while trying to get through basic material. Then, he realizes how far behind we've fallen and skips ahead over all the tricky stuff. As a result, we ended up spending a week and a half on BFS and a day on alpha-beta pruning, and two weeks on symbolic logic followed by fifteen minutes about Bayesian inference.\r\n\r\nThat same vagueness also seems to manifest itself on just about every exam question, which might explain why the average on both midterm and final was below a 60% (and mind you, this is a class made up of half MS and PhD students).\r\n\r\nWhat's really maddening is that on the handful of days he says \"Fuck it, I'm just going to lecture today\" the class is great. If he could be somehow persuaded to do this all the time I would have no hesitation at all in recommending this class; as things are right now, my feelings are mixed.\r\n\r\nOther random thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe TAs were some of the best I've ever had -- friendly, approachable, and (with the exception of one disastrous mistake that made the midterm quite literally 25 times harder) very knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nI came into this class with the rather unique advantage of already knowing Lisp. Regardless of what the syllabus may say, they will teach you no Lisp at all, but you will be expected to know it. If you, like 90% of the class, have never seen it before, you might be well-served by picking up a copy of SICP to read over winter break.\r\n\r\nMake a real effort for the gameplay tournament. Five or ten points is nothing to scoff at when everybody fails the midterm (and it's fun).\r\n\r\ntl;dr. The short answer is that I don't see any good reason not to take this class over Pasik's, and if Stolfo cleans up his act for next year it may even wind up being your favorite.",

Though his lectures are entertaining, they gloss over the course material and provide little to no insight into the concepts, test material, or homework assignments. He always ends class early, for such reasons as \"I'm going salsa dancing!\" When asked a question in class, he often doesn't know the answer and responds with some bs, or says he'll answer it next week with an example. Subsumption, for example, is not hard and something that he should be able to define and provide an example for on the spot, but he can't. His lectures have clearly not been updated in several years, and it shows. It seems like there are typos from the 90's that would take 2 seconds to fix, but doesn't bother to do anything to fix them.\r\n\r\nAll your homework is in LISP and Pasik barely covers LISP in class. Your knowledge of this language comes completely from independent study, and the homeworks are very time consuming. You would think that he could at least provide some sample LISP programs or god forbid tutorials that he quickly googled, but no, he leaves that up to you. As for the actual homeworks themselves, that are so vague and non-descriptive that you'll spend half the time trying to figure out what you have to do. Days or even hours before the due dates, TA's will post requirements on courseworks of things that you must include in the homework. He does not provide solutions to the homework, so you're screwed in that sense. He reuses the homeworks every single year, without changing them at all. This turns out to be bad because he could make the homework prompt more descriptive than 3 sentences. Be prepared to spend 40+ hours for each of the 3 homework assignments, and start them way early (you do have plenty of time). He probably has never read his own culpa reviews, and doesn't realize that he needs to REALLY update his lectures, homeworks, and tests.\r\n\r\nHis tests are ridiculous. No amount of studying can prepare you for them. It's not because you don't know the material, it's because you have to predict the answer that he's looking to hear. Even if you're answer is correct, as the TA agreed with me on several occasions, he could not award points because it was not identical to Pasik's horrible solutions. If you know the material and feel prepared, you can still do poorly because you did not mention something in your answer that was not asked for in the question. You will lose points for not writing a novel for each answer.\r\n\r\nPasik does not hold office hours and does not care about any of his students.

I cannot believe that he would require us to write massively complex programs in a language that (1) is not taught in the class and (2) he doesn't even remember the syntax for something so basic!\r\n\r\nHe does not hold office hours, so the only time you can ask him a question is before or after class, but he employs the same techniques he uses in class to brush off your questions (and you couldn't even go to the TAs for help since they had heavy accents and also had difficulty expressing themselves in English)! Even worse, he didn't even come to class on the last day which was supposed to be our final exam review session, but instead had those same TAs run it. We were not notified of this change until one or two days before the class itself. The TAs did an awful job, just pulling up his PowerPoints and letting us stare at the slides which corresponded to our questions for a few minutes (I'm not kidding - this is exactly what they did).",

First, the early part of the course was dedicated to a thorough consideration of the difference between human-like and rational behavior; in addition, a number of readings were posted over the term that addressed just these issues. Second, this course is offered in a computer science department; the capacity of computer scientists to have impact on scientific or philosophical problems is founded in the algorithmic details.

Howevre, he ungraded assignments definitely help with the exam but the homework IS fundamentally based on a concept from lecture. The homeworks are also pretty fun. A bigger issue was slow grading. I'm taking the course during the summer which means no midterm, only a final worth 40%. The only graded feedback we have received so far was the first homework based on lectures 3 and 4 out of 19.

Given that its a COMS 4xxx class, there are lots of MS students in the class who want to impress him, and mostly end up talking to him about GPT-3 or some other research paper the entire time; he gets off topic very easily. His homeworks are incredibly easy and also taken from Prof. Bauer, and exams are very easy as well.

The programming assignments are super fun and some of the best I've had in the department. We're provided with a  clean scaffolding of the code which is unseen in any of the Intelligent Systems track classes. Because of that I feel like we don't get dragged into writing stupid and time-consuming systems around the crux of whatever we're learning.

This is one of the best courses I have taken in Columbia.\r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown\u2019s class provides a very comprehensive overview of NLP. Topics include language models, neural networks, word embeddings, sentimental analysis, POS tagging, parsing, semantics, machine translation, summarization.\r\n\r\nThe class materials and the homework assignments are a very good combination of theory and coding. For theory, we learn parsing algorithms, read word embedding papers, study the math formula behind those frequently used neural networks. For practice, we implement our own model to do stance prediction, sentimental analysis and machine translation. Assignments often go beyond simple code implementation. Instead, most of the assignment focuses on analysis of the models that we built \u2013 analysis of model performance, error analysis on frequent mistakes made by the model, comparison of different methods and models. These analysis techniques turn out to be very useful in real-word applications, and really distinguish those who know NLP from those who only know how to use packages. \r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown is a very nice person who actually cares about every student that she teaches. She is the first professor that I\u2019ve met with in Columbia who does her best to really remember almost everyone\u2019s name in the classroom (it\u2019s a class of approximately 100 students!) She enjoys meeting with students during office hours, providing not only help for class materials/assignments but also invaluable discussions about students\u2019 future career development and general academic interest. \r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown also knows well about how to teach. She does her best to make the class to interesting to everyone. She is a professor who really does her best to make sure everyone is following and understanding her lectures. She highly values class participation and interaction between professor and students, but speaking up in class is not mandatory for students to get participation points. Fully recognizing that some students may be shy about asking questions or speaking up publicly in class, she uses poll everywhere instead in class to collect students\u2019 feedback and questions to see if anything is unclear to the students. \r\n\r\nThe course materials are very interesting in itself, and I\u2019m especially amazed by the guest lectures of the course. Professor McKeown invited some of her former students who are now working in the industry to give guest lectures. One lecture that is especially inspiring is on dialog systems, where we get to know how dialog systems such as Siri and Alexa are built. Guest lectures from distinguished industry pioneers give the students another perspective on NLP from the industry.\r\n\r\nThe professor also makes sure that the class materials are up-to-date. NLP is a fast-changing field with lots of new concepts and techniques invented each year. Besides the basic materials and concepts of NLP, she also provides a brief walkthrough of a few recent breakthroughs in the academia. For example, we read together in class papers on BERT (a really cool and useful tool that\u2019s very famous) and papers on biases (a really cool and influential topic that appeared in recent years). Students interested in going to the academia or industry get to know these state-of-the-art results and techniques, which bridge the gap between school and future career. \r\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend Professor Kathy McKeown\u2019s class to anyone interested in NLP or anyone interested in knowing more about computer science. The class materials are awesome. The professor is extremely amazing. You will learn a huge amount out of this class. ",

There is some math that comes with the subject but Prof. Bauer explained everything until he felt the entire class grasped the concept. My favorite part was when the class worked through NLP problems together during class, solving theory-based problems that helped make sense of the assigned programming assignments. If you get a chance to take NLP with Prof. Bauer take it! I for one took this class in the summer on top of an already heavy schedule but always found the material satisfying. His problem sets force you to connect the dots from theory to application but it was always satisfying coming to a solution. Sometimes, there were clever optimizations that could be made to improve your code to run in a fraction of the time. It is worth noting that this is the semester I started to really learn Python, so if you already have some familiarity you should be good. The exams were challenging but if you attend class and study diligently you should be okay.

While I liked how he updated his syllabus from the last one, the execution was simply bad. I don't what might have been the issue for him, but after midterms, the course became utterly disorganized. Almost everything was done at the very last minutes. For instance, the videos we were supposed to watch before each flipped classroom sessions were uploaded less than 24 hours prior to my session, making it impossible to studying them thoroughly. And all of the sudden, assignment 3 became analytical part only assignment and assignment 4 became programming part only assignment. While this could a perfectly reasonable thing, but I'm sure I wasn't the only one who felt this was a rushed decision. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Collins is a very knowledgeable man on Natural Language Processing and probably a very nice person. However, how he handled the course after the midterm was simply not acceptable. Just be aware that logistics of the course for Fall 2017 was an utter disaster. ",

We were assigned small (10-15 person) sections, and each week had about 60-90 minutes of coursera videos to watch before hand. At the session he would spend 20 minutes recapping the key points from the videos, then maybe 30 minutes we'd be doing questions (very similar to the exam questions), and discussing the answers with him. Lots of opportunities to ask questions and talk with him, especially if you get a less crowded session. (Note that his original plan was that he'd only do 2 of every 3 weeks for each section, and a TA would do the other. However it seemed like he abandoned this after a while, and combined a few sessions so he could do all of them himself.)\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the format. Keeping up with the lectures before your session was a bit difficult when you have a million other things to do, but pretty important. I fell behind about 3/4ths through when we switched away from machine translation, and it took me a while to catch up again. It was also a little disappointing that you almost never saw who else was in the class, since a bit of discussion about the homework with other students was quite valuable. \r\n\r\nThere is no textbook, but he has a set of classnotes online that's basically an alpha version of a textbook, along with the slides he used in the coursera video.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I had with the class was general non-responsiveness on Piazza. There were a LOT of questions about the assignments, and the TAs just generally didn't respond. The TA led discussion sections were also basically useless for me, although the TAs also seemed nice and were trying hard, they just weren't up to Collins' level. ",

Each one was probably 10-20 hours of coding.\r\n\r\nmidterm + final, both of which were quite doable. However, the types of questions he asks are mostly of the \"do something with a toy grammar\" type that you're asked in the flipped classrooms.

I enjoyed the class and I'd recommend it. I also wish that every CS professor would switch to flipped classroom.\r\n\r\nEvery week, he assigned about an hour and a half of video lectures from Coursera. These lectures are incredibly clear and the great thing about them being online is that you can watch them 80 times over until you understand the material. I usually space out during CS lectures, so this was invaluable for me. Then you attend a weekly (~10 people) discussion session where you do problems taken from previous exams. This was more like him handing out the questions, everyone staring blankly at them for a few minutes, and him explaining the answers. Repeat for an hour. These discussions were led by him and the TAs, and they usually felt awkward, but they were useful. They were supposed to be mandatory but he stopped taking UNIs after a few weeks, and I don't think they really ended up being mandatory. Toward the end of the semester, a lot of people stopped going. He posted textbook style notes about the lectures as well as classroom questions and solutions online after each week.\r\n\r\nAs someone whose programming skills were rusty and mediocre at best, I found the homework to be challenging but not at all impossible. I recommend using Python, and if you don't know it, it will be easy to learn. For the programming, you're literally just implementing the algorithms that you learned in class, so it's not so much thinking about how to solve the problems as it is deciding what data structures to use and being careful with your code. They were sometimes unusually time consuming though.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were usually pretty helping during office hours, and not as helpful on Piazza. Prof Collins did not hold office hours, and he explained that the flipped classroom would be the time for office hour questions.\r\n\r\nDefinitely come in with solid knowledge of probability. You'll need a little bit of calc and linear algebra toward the end.

He explains topics thoroughly and thoughtfully and takes time during class to answer all questions. He'll give printouts of slides to you as well as post them online. (The slides themselves are really only meant to supplement his lecture though\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are some classes where the slides are a good substitute for in-class notes; this is not the case here.) For some of the bigger topics (part of speech tagging, machine translation, etc.) he'll also type up his own notes that cover the subject pretty well. Overall an approachable and friendly guy. \r\n\r\nAs for the course itself, like a previous reviewer said, Collins definitely brings some rigor to a class that is generally within Julia Hirschberg's realm of teaching. The class felt like applied machine learning at times, and you were at an advantage if you've taken some sort of ML before, and a strong foundation in statistics is important to really understand what's going on. The average on some assignments and quizzes were really low (a third of the class got less than 50% on the second quiz), but the class is curved. The tests were a mix of applying basic knowledge on a topic and adapting algorithms learned in class to some unique situation. The analytical part of the homeworks were generally in a similar spirit. Grading was a bit harsh at first but seemed to let up towards the end. \r\n\r\nIf you know 1) your stats and/or 2) have taken some ML before and 3) want to learn NLP from one of the top people in the field, there's no question you should take this class. If you just want to do #3, it'll take you a little more effort, but you'll probably muddle your way through like the rest of us.

Prof. Vondrick went over every topic carefully, and the his lecture slides were crystal clear. The coding homework assignments with Python and PyTorch were also easy, but HW2 might take longer since you have to build a neural network from scratch. The rest can be knocked out in an hour or two though.\n\nThe final quiz was also a breeze if you paid attention in class. In fact, Prof. Vondrick dropped hints for most of the final's questions and their answers throughout the semester, so it's in your best interest to go to class or watch the Zoom recordings.\n\nGrading was more than fair. There were two strategies to assign letter grades and Prof. Vondrick automatically picked the strategy that gave you the best grade. The first strategy was a curve. The second strategy was the standard grading scale:\n90% overall guarantees at least A-\n80% overall guarantees at least B-\n70% overall guarantees at least C-\n\nMost people finished with an A.

                "content": "This review ended up rather long, so TL;DR: this class is hard and confusing- do not take it!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I strongly do not recommend taking this class. It was probably my least favorite class I ever had to take at Columbia (disclaimer: I just took it as a second semester senior so I may be biased, but I still think this is a very honest assessment). I wanted to avoid taking Machine Learning because I was trying to have a chill semester, but I wish I had instead.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pe\u2019er is an extremely nice guy, which makes me hesitant to write a poor review, but I had a very bad experience with this class. The material is hard, but what truly made this class truly difficult is the lack of resources to learn from. Usually, I can rely on the lectures, class notes, or the textbook to learn the material for a class. However, I could not understand the lectures due to Professor Pe\u2019er\u2019s delivery and stuttering, the class notes were confusing and extremely difficult to study from, and there was no textbook.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pe\u2019er has an accent, but it is the stammering and stuttering that made it almost impossible for me to understand what was going on in class. He also spoke through a microphone which further distorted his sentences. I\u2019m not trying to exaggerate, but it took intense concentration and patience during lecture to make sense of each sentence for me (moreso than any lecture I\u2019ve ever had). Eventually, as a second semester senior, it was just too much effort for me and I was mostly zoned out during class.\r\n\r\nThere was no textbook to learn the material from. Thus, I was left with learning from the class powerpoints. The slides did not contain full explanations of concepts and diagrams, so they were very hard to decipher. I mostly ended up googling topics and watching Youtube videos to try and learn the material. This class is a mix of computer science, biology, and statistics and the material is unsurprisingly very hard to understand.\r\n\r\nThe problems sets were long and extremely difficult (8 in total). Most of the questions were worded poorly and required extensive clarification on Piazza before you could understand them. Given that the material itself was difficult and confusing, they took me hours and hours to complete. After a couple problem sets, I just stopped caring and scribbled down whatever work that looked okay because it wasn\u2019t worth the time stressing over it.\r\n\r\nFor the midterm, you had to answer 3/8 questions. Not surprisingly, it was hard as well- the average was a 64. It was open book/note, but I didn\u2019t even use anything I brought in. Afterwards, he gave us an extra credit assignment where we had to solve 3 more of the midterm problems (full credit received half the points between your grade and the highest class grade). If you do take this class, I would just focus on learning on 2-3 of the main topics that will appear on the exam (BWT, HMMs, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe project was okay. I was worried our project was too simple because everyone else\u2019s sounded complicated, but most groups didn\u2019t come close to getting good results so don\u2019t overexert yourself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this was one of the most frustrating and challenging classes I took as an undergrad, and unfortunately it was during my last semester here. Avoid taking it, unless you are truly interested in the subject- just take ML!!!! Sorry Professor!",

                "content": "Everyone kind of sits on the continuum between weeding out people, and helping them learn. Professor Pe'er is definitely on the latter. Here's why:\r\n\r\n1) Only 80% completion of your homework is required, i.e. an 80% translates to 100%. Now, I'll caveat this by saying these assignments are done weekly for the first half, and some of them are pretty tough if you weren't paying careful attention in class.\r\n\r\n2) Feedback, feedback, and feedback. Every homework assignment you turn in gets notes meant solely for you. Your final project will have presentations, and you will get feedback from both classmates AND the professor and/or TA, each time.\r\n\r\n3) A steady/reliable pace with a very welcoming attitudes towards questions. He leaves his cell phone, personal email, and allows skype sessions over the weekend - just to help you learn or get help with your project.\r\n\r\n4) Cameron (the TA) is super nice and adopts the same attitude as Professor Pe'er - he only wants you to learn.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, this course is heavily front-loaded - it's going to be a sprint the first half. I can't speak for everyone else, but I really appreciated this - it gave me more time to work on my project (the last half of the semester), and deal with the impending deadlines for all my other classes.\r\n\r\nNow, some caveats:\r\n\r\n1) His lecture style is pseudo-interactive, or at least tries to be. He asks a lot of questions to check comprehension, and there were plenty of awkward moments where nobody answered a very obvious question (albeit, I'm not sure if it's because we were all scared because it wasn't obvious at the time or because nobody cared. Likely the former).\r\n\r\n2) I see other people complain about his voice, his stuttering, blah blah, but if you're interested in the material, then you'll likely pay attention naturally (and you should; it's interesting stuff).\r\n\r\n3) The material -can- be hard to follow. It's -a lot- in roughly 2/3rds of the semester. Some of it is almost hand-wavey. This is especially true if you've never had exposure to genomics, or even biology. That being said, I came in here with 0 biology background, and was okay.",

He has prepared slides that he talked over and annotates, which means it can be hard to keep up when taking handwritten notes since I have to write down everything (plus any annotations) in the same time it takes him to talk about them (and try and listen to what he says). This was more manageable in the start of the semester, but after the material got increasingly more difficult, I couldn't keep up. I was having a hard time understanding all the lectures, and I thought maybe the issue was just that I didn't have a tablet for note taking, but it turned out almost everyone I knew in the class was similarly struggling. I've ended up having to rewatch every lecture after class so that I can follow. He's just not a great lecturer, and I'm not sure how much is really sticking.",

                "workload": "The exams are incredibly difficult (the second exam had a median of 40 before he curved it up a bit) and unlike the content of the class (they are much more theoretical). It is hard to feel prepared for them at all. They are also pretty much the only component of your grade.\n\nHe curves the class supposedly, but the curve doesn't seem to be very generous either. Lots of people dropped the class right before the drop deadline (after the first two exams), and that presumably would bring the median grade of the class up (since we can assume most ppl who dropped did so because his grading was so harsh they were worried about failing the class or doing very poorly). I asked him if someone who had received grades around the median for the past two exam might still expect to received a B/B+ (what he had said the median of the class usually was curved to) or if they might end up with a lower grade (since being around the median before people dropping would likely mean falling below the median after people dropping), and he just said he can't see the grades of people who drop when grading. I took this to mean the dropped people aren't accounted for int he curve, and therefore, even being around the median most most of the class could lead to a low final grade. It seems that there is no winning in the class unless you are one of the best. If you start in the bottom of the class, you're worried about failing or receiving a D and drop. If you start in the middle of the class, you may end up falling well below the median in the curve for the final grade.\n\nAlso, it just feels like he's petty about grading. 90% of our grade comes from exam grades, but 10% comes from multiple choice quizzes on Gradescope. Up until the 7th quiz, most people were getting everything right on them and receiving 100%s. After that, he started putting \"trick\" questions on them that seem designed to trip everybody up (and these questions seem to have gotten at least 75% of the class since the upper quartile of the scores on canvas didn't full marks either). I don't get why he'd what to sabotage the one part of the grading that was buoying everyone's grade just the smallest bit."

I appreciate that admission is based on a math preparedness assessment so I got a sense of what I was required to know. The exams, though ominously long, at least provided many opportunities to earn points. However, I don't think this model actually imparted much lasting knowledge on me. The homeworks, while optional, were exceedingly difficult and discouraged me from even trying to solve them. This turned my studying frantic with few examples of problems at the appropriate difficulty, and exams for me became an exercise in scoring as many easy points as possible. Now, just a few weeks after the final, I don't feel that I retained much.\n\nSignificantly more egregious is, as an earlier reviewer put it, the \"cult of personality\" following Prof. Verma. This ego often manifested into 15-minute sessions of guessing what he used to do at Amazon or getting into time-wasting battles of wits with his favorite students. I often found myself thinking about how a female professor with this level of toxicity would never be entertained, and how Verma's ego represents everything wrong with today's CS field. I hated that my learning seemed to always suffer for preservation of his egotistical nature, and I particularly resent how often he brought up that he wouldn't read/listen to course reviews\u2014exactly why this course seems to have stagnated in its deficiencies.",

Half of lecture is spent on explaining extraneous probability/statistics proofs, a third is spent on flaming students for answering questions wrong (which he and for some reason the same group of students who always answer seem to enjoy a lot), and the rest is spent on briefly going over what a certain classification/regression technique is used for. The amount of actual machine learning material covered is quite small, but instead of diving deep into tradeoffs or use cases of a model we dive deep into convex optimization and singular value decomposition. It wouldn't be so bad if this Bayesian bully wasn't also borderline abusive to the students. One time in the section 3 lecture he spent 10 minutes grilling a student for having a \"pseudo intellectual\" answer to some question and then held us after class because we ran out of time. Another time he straight up threw one of his TAs under the bus in class for writing a bad question in a homework assignment as if he shouldn't also be responsible for vetting the question.

The problem sets are interesting but I found them to be so difficult that doing well on them was mostly a matter of having time to go to office hours for the solutions. Moreover, they are extremely time consuming, and I would argue excessively so for a 3 credit class.\nThe midterm was not too bad, but Verma corrected that mistake with the final which was quite literally the hardest exam I've ever taken in my life. With that said, the class is curved so on net I guess that doesn't matter much. \nTo end on a good note, lectures are good and I feel I learned a lot, even with some prior background in ML. Verma is a very good instructor when it comes to lecturing and explaining proofs and concepts. The only knock I have on the lecture component of the class is that we didn't get to HMMs which were the part of the class I was most looking forward to.",

Maybe the downside is that the class is not curved, so I felt high pressure to achieve perfect grades on everything.

To begin with, he is a clear and organized (and kind of funny!) lecturer, his course content is presented in an order that is logical and builds on itself. His lectures are paced well and doesn't try to cover too much content. If you are a person that has difficulty following along in lectures, the lectures are recorded and the slides are on his course website. Professor Verma is usually good about repeating inaudible questions from the class before answering them too. \r\n\r\nThe content is a mix of theory/application, which he mentions early on. He goes through major proofs for ML theorems, but is pretty reasonable about what is in the scope of the class and as a result the math doesn't get too crazy or super irrelevant. \r\n\r\nThe class had no required textbook which is financial plus - and the reading cited on his website were clear supplements that don't go over your head. \r\n\r\nI really recommend making sure you have an okay foundation in linear algebra, maybe prob stats as well. You don't need to be fresh off getting an A in lin alg, but the workload is heavy enough that if you are already taking a full course/research load, it may be difficult to find time to both catch up on the prereq knowledge and also submit thoroughly completed problem sets. He made a couple of jokes about putting test questions that dealt with certain distributions on them, but really all we needed for the class was an understanding of the Gaussian and binomial/Bernoulli distribution.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt like the class was a great introduction to machine learning, and sets up a foundation for future study well.

If you are concerned with whether you have background knowledge, this pset will let you know well before the drop deadline.\r\n\r\nThe next first four problem sets were time consuming - mitigated by the fact that you can work in groups of three. The questions themselves were not impossible, and any exceedingly difficult portions were quickly revised by the instructor/TA team to be \"bonus\" questions. He was reasonable giving out extensions. If you have team members and start early, they are doable. I would recommend starting early, especially as the code for one problem set took hours to converge - it's not something you'd want to start last minute. \r\n\r\nThe last problem set (for the Spring 2019) semester, was individual and worth only 5%, but was assigned during finals week. The task was to make predictions based from real world data. \r\n\r\nAll of the problem sets served to further understanding of the material, however because they were so long, you may not have time to adequately study the answers/practice with them for the exams. \r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were each worth 30%. The class averages were around 35% and 40%, results are curved. If you treat them like exams in a math class, study the material but focus on working through practice problems, you will be fine.

This course is epic. \r\n\r\nThis course covers the foundation of machine learning. You will learn different machine learning algorithms from the foundation supported by math and proofs. \r\n\r\nI have weak mathematics before taking this class. My math background only has intermediate-level linear algebra, calculus, and intro-level probability. I haven't done math problems for three years.  Before taking this course, I also have completed Andrew Ng's online course. Before enrolling, I thought I might struggle in this class but, in fact, I survived well and really enjoyed my experience. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is not a relaxing course. It is challenging, but it is not a hard course! What I mean is that the course homework and tests are challenging, but this course is amazingly organized and Verma is an extremely capable instructor. Even though this is a challenging course, I feel safe and comfortable when I sit in the class even though with a weak math background because of Verma's teaching. Verma is very patient on teaching his topics and he cares about how his students learn with quality rather than quantity. He is a strict yet kind instructor. I could feel that he ardently cares about his class and his student. His teaching is perfect. I can understand everything that has been taught in his class even with my weak math background. The pace of the class is slow and nobody would feel lost.  \r\n\r\nThe homework are challenging but are interesting to solve. If you spend time on them you can always find solutions. TAs are also helpful in Piazza and OH. The tests are also challenging. However, grades are generously scaled and you might get A- if you get 60% in tests. \r\n\r\nI learned so many things from this course and it helped me build a fundamental understanding of machine learning problems. If you really want to work in ML-related careers or research, this is the recommended intro-level course. If you hesitate whether this course is too hard, I would say be brave and enroll. You will be fine (suppose you can get 70% right for the homework 0, which is the precondition of enrolling in this class . 70% is not a hard target). \r\n\r\nColumbia University's tuition fees are expensive.

Try to pick your teammates cautiously, because if you don't, you'll be the one doing most of the work, which means a lot of hours into homework. I usually go to at least 6 hours of OH every week and read/post on Piazza to figure out the homework. But the homework problems are all interesting! And Professor and TAs are very helpful and responsive both in person and on Piazza. Fortunately, we only had four graded problem sets and the last one is optional. And no homework was due during spring break, which is nice.\r\n\r\nExams: Professor Verma made clear that usually you can pick some questions to finish; this is true. Due to the time constraint of 75~80 minutes, and there are 6 problems in total, I usually can only finish 4~5 problems and not all of what I wrote would be correct. But there's curve, so don't sweat too much. It's supposed to be hard!\r\n\r\nThis class teaches various topics on machine learning and I feel I actually know stuff about ML now.

                "content": "Prof Verma's Machine Learning class is a confusing mixture of being not technical enough and over-technical at the same time. He assumes knowledge of some advanced multivariate calculus, multivariate probability and linear algebra without going through the techniques explicitly or in any systematic way, while the prerequisite classes cover nothing close to what he requires. This could be partly due to the fact that half the class are grad students, with the overall result that undergrads feel very left behind. At the same time, Prof Verma introduces results of some advanced derivations, skipping over the math in class entirely with the reason that \"it is too easy/simple/boring\", but expects you to reproduce it in a test. He focuses on teaching the \"intuition\" behind the proofs, yet fails to understand that \"intuition\" comes from understanding, which is impossible for most students unless he goes more into the math. \r\n\r\nAnother huge blindspot for the course is that Prof Verma does not give out solutions for his practice exams. This could seem forgivable, except the homework questions are nothing like exam questions (problem sets are more like mini-projects while exam questions are just out of nowhere), so students who have seen questions of this type for the first time are forced to study without any guide or solution. This coupled with reasons mentioned in the above paragraph result in overall confusion before the exams. (In addition, no one does well on the actual exams). The lack of solutions handed out caused some Piazza savagery in my section, which I feel was actually quite justified. I hope Prof Verma sees this and realizes that no learning happens if the correct answer is not given. Perhaps he believes in unsupervised learning, but the results of this can be unboundedly far from the global optimal. \r\n\r\nAs an example of how ridiculous the technical expectations for this class is, during class Prof Verma regularly mentions Convex Optimization, some material from which is relevant in class. I looked up Convex Optimization and it is E6616 - a 6000-level course. If you're not prepared to deal with some 6000-course material that will not be explicitly taught to you, you may not want to take this Machine Learning course. I personally feel it is a shame because the material is super interesting and relevant, and could have been much better taught. A suggestion is a more depth, and less breadth, could improve the class significantly.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class seems to reward prior knowledge, rather than diligence over the course, which is something I have an issue with.\r\n",

                "content": "I took Machine Learning with Professor Pe'er in Spring 2017 - I've been tardy about writing a review, but I feel it is necessary. I am genuinely in awe at how bad my experience in this class was, in seemingly every way.\r\n\r\nTo start: Professor Pe'er. It is fortunate that this man is, in fact, a professor - were I to call him \"Instructor Pe'er\", one may get the false impression that he is capable of instructing anyone. He is not. I have never seen a human so uniquely unsuited for pedagogy as this man. His classroom delivery is a complete trainwreck - when he's not stumbling over his words or saying \"ehm\" for 15 seconds, the words he does say are incomprehensible, even when explaining material that is clearly within students' grasp. Unfortunately, most of his lectures did not fall into this category, as the prerequisites for this class grossly understate the necessary statistical background. As a CS student with only an intro-level stats background, I rarely had any idea what the hell was going on in lecture. Professor Pe'er's attempt to bridge this gap was laughably insufficient: he spent one day at the beginning of the semester attempting to speed through all of statistics. It didn't play well.\r\n\r\nHere is how Pe'er explained what a convex surface was: he brought a muffin into class, and passed it around the room. Here is how he explained differences in dimensionality: he printed out a picture of Antarctica, wrapped it around an apple, and placed it under an overhead projector. He proceeded to stab the apple with a knife, cutting out the outline of Antarctica. I wish I were joking. One gets the impression that he might not know the difference between \"preparing for lecture\" and \"purchasing lunch\".\r\n\r\nThe homeworks, while being the only useful part of the course as far as my own learning was concerned, similarly left a lot to be desired. Each problem set was written in impossibly dense and questionable English, requiring several hours of what was essentially decoding by TAs and other students before the meaning became clear. After this, the process of completing the homework wasn't much better. There was a STRONG emphasis on the mathematical background of the material, which I wasn't a fan of: despite having completed a course in machine learning in the computer science department, I feel I've gained almost no intuition for how/when to use the models we supposedly learned. Focusing on the math behind ML seems to be typical of 4705; this could have been fine if the instructor was capable of pulling it off. He was not.\r\n\r\nEven Pe'er's slide decks were of marginal use, combining incomplete/incomprehensible sentence fragments, mathematical derivations that were somehow both excessively long and too incomplete to actually follow, and completely indecipherable scrawlings done in class. The textbook for the class was also too dense for a beginner in the subject to comfortably consult. In order to be able to complete the homeworks, my classmates and I had to teach ourselves all the material from slides we found online from other universities. Literally nothing the professor provided to us contributed to our learning in any capacity.\r\nThe only saving grace was that the TAs were all qualified, helpful, and not completely devoid of pedagogical abilities - unlike the professor.\r\n\r\nI regret this class more than any class I have ever taken in my time at Columbia. I had read the previous Culpa reviews and thought, \"Oh, it'll be fine.\" I flew too close to the sun. It was not fine. Do not take it. Do not take any class with Pe'er.\r\n",

I believe he used Daniel Hsu's syllabus and materials throughout the course, but his style was much different. While Daniel focuses heavily on the math and the proofs and (I would assume) hope that intuition on the mechanisms of the ML models follows, Satyen would focus heavily on the visuals and step-by-step walkthroughs of everything before touching on the math. He hadn't taught before, but I feel like coming from industry was a boon because he seemed comfortable going through the same concepts a couple times to make sure everyone got it. He managed to make almost everything (even kernels!) readily digestible, and made me feel confident in being to implement models later in the homeworks.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with him was the mathematical rigor of the exams. He lifted them straight from Daniel, who spends _his_ classes delving into math, so the dissonance between Satyen's style and the first midterm was jarring. When students pointed this out on Piazza, he made an effort to include more proof-based questions on the homeworks to give us exposure to the type of questions we might expect on the final. I still didn't do too well on the final, but neither did anyone else. \r\n",

This is both good and bad. It is bad because he will sometimes explain things as though we are all on his level, when really no one else is. Additionally, the homework problems can be very challenging and overly mathematical. However, Daniel is more than happy to answer any questions during lectures, so make sure to ask if something gets glossed over. Additionally, you will really understand machine learning after taking this course. I recommend that you print out the slides and take notes on them, as for me they were useless without commentary (because I am not on Daniel's level). \r\n\r\nTAs:\r\nOur TAs tried really hard, but a few of them fell very short. They often could not help with homework and were unable to answer questions about exams. However, homeworks were graded fairly leniently to make up for this. I was fine with the compromise as I still learned a lot, though it was very frustrating at times when trying to complete difficult homework problems. The best thing was there were a lot of TAs and there were at least one set of office hours each day.\r\n\r\nHomeworks:\r\nMost homeworks involved a MATLAB component that was never too difficult, and was always my favorite part of the assignments. It was cool to actually apply everything and have a classifier that had a low error. Some people thought that these parts relied too heavily on understanding the tricks of MATLAB, but I always just had long runtimes and didn't bother too much with optimization. I never got points taken off for this. The written parts of the homework could be too mathy for me. Additionally, everything had to be typeset so you couldn't just write it out and then take a picture of it, which always added at least an hour to the write-up. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nThe first exam was extremely long. I don't think anyone finished early. It was tough but I think it worked out pretty fair with the curve. The second exam wasn't so long but I thought it was extremely hard. There were some questions that were straight linear algebra without even having an ML twist on them, which I thought was ridiculous as I had taken CLA 2 and a half years before. However, the curve on that ended up okay too and I think the curve overall was also very fair. I did put in at least 90% effort into this class, but I still ended up with a higher grade than I expected.\r\n\r\nReadings:\r\nThere is a statistics textbook that I couldn't even read it was so over my head. However, the actual ML textbook can be very helpful and is great to read after lectures to clarify things. There weren't as many readings in the second half of the class and I pretty much stopped doing them after the first exam.",

                "content": "This is a decent class where you will be challenged, put up with lousy instruction but learn a good deal in the process. Daniel Hsu is a super smart professor but about as engaging as a piece of wood. He knows the material in and out and leave you with an appreciation for ML by the end. The class runs pretty smoothly from an operational perspective. The response time on Piazza is insane - Daniel gets back to you in a few hours, especially right before HW deadlines and exams. His answers aren't generally helpful. You see a lot of monosyllabic \"No\"s as answers and he will put you down if your question is stupid or poorly worded (thank god for anonymity). However, when he does deem your question worthy, you get a thorough response.\r\n\r\nThe course assumes you have a decent background in calculus, statistics and linear algebra. Daniel does not pull any punches on the math. If you've taken Calc III, Linear Algebra and Intro to Probability and Stats, you should be fine. You have to be familiar with some matrix calculus, basic probability and stats (multivariate Gaussians, expectations, Baye's rule), projections, eigenvectors and SVD from linear algebra.\r\n\r\nDaniel focuses a lot on a lot of theory in machine learning and less on practice. Lots of long proofs and details on the math behind classification models. I personally think this is excellent since ML is inherently a very mathematical subject and understanding it at this level is key. We covered MLE, generative models, decision tress, linear classifiers, perceptrons, SVM, kernels, some ML theory, boosting, regression, PCA, clustering, entropy, HMMs and some math behind a lot of these topics in detail in their own dedicated lectures. Lots of good stuff!\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to stay awake in class since he turned off the lights in 501 NoCo and is a pretty boring lecturer. He doesn't engage with students unless someone asks a question. Thankfully, his slides are great and available online. I encourage you to try to pay attention in class because sometimes the slides are hard to understand on your own right before the exam at the last minute.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks were reasonable and consisted of a mix of theory and programming questions. They were challenging but nothing you couldn't do by spending some time pouring over the slides and going to office hours. Some of the theory questions were hard and it took my hours reading lecture notes or going to office hours to figure them out. The programming part tends to be simple but you have to vectorize your code for it to take minutes not hours, which can be a bit tricky. Assuming you don't pay attention in lecture (because it's really hard to) and that you have to read the slides from scratch to solve the HW, it takes 8+ hours of work on average. TAs were not helpful since they often couldn't solve the homework themselves.\r\n\r\nHis exams are impossible. Numerical grading on tests and homeworks was very generous and countered the difficulty of the exams. However, his letter grade assignments are on the harsh side.\r\n\r\nI heard StatML with Cunningham is fantastic. He's a great lecturer and focuses on intuition. If you want a more practical course, I would suggest that. If you're a CS major in the Foundations or AI tracks and need ML to count towards your track requirements, you're out of luck. Daniel's class is not bad and I would take it again even though it was a little painful.",

It's great but pretty difficult.\r\n\r\nThe overall curriculum of the course is heavily mathematical. There is relatively little concern with \"real-world\" issues like cleaning data or choosing good features. There were some students who sounded like they wanted a course that would teach them how to apply canned algorithms from sklearn or something. It's more about how to implement those algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe first half covered classification problems of various kinds, followed by some learning theory. There's some statistics which comes from a really interesting and unique perspective. It's the first time I've felt statistics wasn't boring. The second half covered unsupervised learning (clustering, etc.) and Markov models. Sprinkled throughout are theoretical discussions of optimization techniques used to fit various models. Finally, the last few lectures were just topics that the professor thought would be enriching, most notably a lecture on how rating prediction systems like Netflix actually work.\r\n\r\nThe class structure is pretty normal -- readings (that you can get by without doing), lectures, and problem sets, plus two exams.\r\n\r\nThe course had a Piazza board, which the professor was always watching. He would give clear, excellent answers, even at weird hours in the middle of the night. He also remained available the night before a problem set. I thought it was nice that he didn't pretend we had good time management skills, although I agree floating late days would have been good, or at least penalties for late assignments rather than refusing to accept them outright.\r\n\r\nThe lecture slides are all posted online and are detailed and excellent. I didn't need to take any notes. But this doesn't mean it's not worth going to lectures! Prof. Hsu is a good lecturer, although sort of quiet. His explanations perfectly complemented the slides. When students asked questions, he listened carefully and gave very clear and cogent answers.\r\n\r\nWe covered a ton of ground, at a decent level of mathematical sophistication. I think perhaps the professor overestimated our mathematical competence. However, those high expectations along with his good teaching skills made this a great class.

Getting the code to work correctly was usually easy, but the datasets were large enough that efficiency was actually a serious issue, requiring lots of MATLAB tricks.\r\n\r\nExams were another story. There were two non-cumulative exams, both in-class.

But if you want an easy ML survey course, go take AI, which is pretty much that.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n\r\nProfessor Hsu is by no means the most charismatic lecturer at Columbia, but he teaches a solid ML course. His lectures are thorough and rigorous -- he does not succumb to the temptation to use teaching a survey course as an excuse to skim easy topics at a high level -- and the online lecture notes are quite good. \r\n\r\nAlso, it was really nice that the two textbooks the course uses are both available online for free, legally, and that he provided us links to them, unlike so many professors who assign the $300 latest edition of [insert textbook] without giving students' finances a second thought.\r\n\r\nI was absolutely amazed how fast he responds to Piazza questions; he was single-handedly more responsive than a crew of about 8 TAs in another of my classes. The responses, always within a few hours, are sometimes not what the poster is hoping for (monosyllables aren't unusual: quite a few questions get a \"no.\" and no more, particularly if they're stuff like extension requests), but the question is invariably answered in full. And that means stuff like \"what should we review for the final?\" gets answered with a 28-point bulleted list.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n\r\nNo floating late days. There's a reason almost every CS class offers them, and it's both because they avoid all the whining on Piazza from people who put their work off to the last minute and because they provide a way to grant a bit of deadline flexibility without being unfair to anyone. Professor Hsu, if you read this, you really should consider having a few floating late days.\r\n\r\nThe first midterm was to a considerable degree just a speed test (caveat: I didn't feel that way; I mostly missed points for not being able to remember material. But everyone else I spoke to felt it was a speed test) and the curve was, by CS department standards, fairly tough.\r\n\r\nThe lecture hall (the huge one in NoCo) was dimly lit and has poor acoustics, which didn't make staying awake through lecture any easier given that Hsu isn't exactly lecturing at John McWhorter levels of energy most of the time.",

Each homework had a programming component, to be done in MATLAB, but Hsu provided code to handle a lot of the tedious/extraneous stuff (e.g. rendering two images side by side); I found the programming to be a really effective introduction to MATLAB, which I'd never used before, and liked being able to focus only on the ML parts of programming.\r\n\r\n2 in-class midterms.

However, our class was very unfortunate to have been taught by Professor Pe'er. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had in my academic experience. To add insult to injury, he is very unapologetic about the way he manages things and treats his students unfairly. \r\n\r\nAssignments:\r\nEvery assignment included grammatical errors and unintelligible sentences in addition to mistakes in the problem descriptions. As a result, 1-2 day assignment would turn into a week-long affair. Future assignments are also based on answers to previous ones even though the class was not given the solution to the previous assignment. As a result, students who might have had incorrect answers in the previous assignment would unknowingly have errors in the next assignment.\r\n\r\nMisinformation:\r\nProfessor Pe'er likes to portray himself as a fair individual but time and time again did he prove us wrong. Our first quiz was multiple choice test where correct answers were given 3 points and incorrect negative 2. However, the class was not told that leaving answers blank would result in negative marks too. Another example of this kind of behavior was demonstrated when he ran a poll to decide whether assignments should be due on a Friday or Wednesday. >80% of students who voted, voted for Friday yet the Professor appeared to have conveniently forgotten to tell the class that over 60% of the entire class needed to participate in the poll for it to be deemed valid. Something he decided to tell us after the fact. \r\n\r\nSadly there are many more examples of this kind of behavior which is simply unprofessional. \r\n\r\nI can't speak to how Prof Jebara might teach this class and whether it's any better. But my main advice would be to stay away from Prof Pe'er, simply because you'll waste more time clearing up any confusions than being able to dedicate time to the actual subject.\r\n\r\n ",

                "content": "Prof. Pe'er is really well-intentioned, and it's clear that he cares a lot about his students. I took a lot away from this class, even though it was a struggle. That said, DO NOT take this class if you're not remotely interested in machine learning - it's _not_ worth it. There are several other breadth/AI track courses that are (possibly) more interesting. If you _are_ interested in the subject, however, I'd definitely recommend taking this class with him instead of with Prof. Jebara. \r\n\r\n1) Teaching: If you have trouble staying awake in classes where professors speak really slowly/if you've ever been in one of the Mudd classrooms and know how boring they are, BRING COFFEE/TEA/anything that keeps you awake. Prof. Pe'er speaks really slowly, so much so that when you play his lectures at 1.5x speeds (they're all on CVN, which is great), it sounds like most people speaking at a normal pace. \r\n2) The material: While the class is very math-heavy (as are most courses on machine learning), Prof. Pe'er is very generous with his use of examples to provide better intuitions for the concepts/algorithms covered, and even tries to do live demonstrations to help make the math clearer. Some lectures and topics have a very steep learning curve even if you have the prerequisites covered, but I learned a tremendous amount from this class and I don't think I would have gotten that much from Prof. Jebara's far more theoretical approach. \r\n3) Homework: The homework is time consuming, not because each individual assignment is long, but because there are assignments EVERY WEEK. The assignments are hard, so starting in advance is essential (which means you're usually working on ML assignments 4 days a week at least), and responses on Piazza from the TAs are erratic and come in waves, so they're not reliable. Prof. Pe'er does allow group work with some constraints, so that usually makes working on assignments easier. But START EARLY. The assignments are also usually vaguely worded, which was a pain to deal with.\r\n4) The tests: This was the most confusing part of the class. I think Prof. Pe'er experimented with a lot of testing styles because it was his first time teaching this class. (Either that, or he always throws 4 different testing styles at his students in all his other classes too because he thinks it builds character.) \r\n- Quizzes: multiple choice, where any number of choices could be true or false, and you lost points for either answering wrong or not answering at all. (So really, you had a 50% chance of getting it right anyway..) The questions on the quiz were theoretical and just requierd you to know the concepts, and some involved doing some basic calculations/inferences.\r\n- Midterm: Easily the best test in this class. It was take-home and entirely programming, with 50% of the grade going towards an explanation of your approach. I think the grading was pretty fair - you got graded on the performance of your approach for the programming part, and the quality of your approach for the explanation. Very straightforward and doable in the 4 day timeframe given.\r\n- Final: This came out of nowhere - the questions on the final ranged from proofs to algorithm creation to calculations - basically a very, very difficult exam. He gave us a practice final that, as it turned out, exactly resembled the actual final, but it still gave us no way to prepare, given that all the testing methods we'd had before were so different. It was almost impossibly long (though challenging and very interesting, required you to actually apply knowledge to real-world problems).\r\n\r\n5) The curve: VERY generous curve. Another reason to definitely take this class with him and not Prof. Jebara. I think he really recognizes how hard he makes the class (in terms of workload, learning curve, difficulty of final) and curves to a high-ish B+. A large percentage of the class got A-range grades. \r\n\r\nAgain, this is a professor who really cares about his students and the effort they put in, and isn't just looking to make this class frustrating and impossible. In general, he's very very responsive to feedback, even takes reasonable requests for class-wide extensions, and always tries really hard to make sure ever single student understands. I haven't had many 4000-level classes where that's the case, so this was refreshing. The class is still extremely frustrating, but ultimately rewarding if you like the material and put a lot of effort into the work.",

                "content": "Top 5 (out of 1,024) reasons to avoid this course at all costs:\r\n\r\n1. No matter how much Prob/Stats or Linear Algebra or just MATH in general you *think* you know, you're not ready for this course (especially if you're an undergrad.. if you're a superstar Ph.D student, make your own judgement).  For example, on one of the homeworks, we were asked to perform vector calculus, which is usually not covered in any of the prerequisites. Another example is when we were asked to do multiple indefinite integrals of a particularly long formula, by hand, during a midterm as a problem worth 20% of the grade.\r\n\r\n2. He goes through very few examples in class, (and when he does, only a select few understand him) which means that most of the homework problems you have absolutely no idea how to do, even if you took the best notes humanly possible in his incredibly dull lectures. For this reason, academic honesty in its strictest definition (no looking through internet for answers, no collaboration on homeworks) is nowhere to be found, because it is impossible to do 90% of the workload in this class otherwise.\r\n\r\n3. He can't teach. I will leave it at this because no other words can describe how truly bad he is.\r\n\r\n4. Since this isn't an absolute requirement for any tracks (even for AI, you can take much better courses such as Spoken Language Processing), you can do yourself a favor and take this same course on Coursera or other excellent online alternatives if you would really like to learn Machine Learning. This is more ideal since Jebara's class is the least efficient place to do any learning.\r\n\r\n5. http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/ Look at his picture. He is smiling smugly at the pains you will have to go through to survive in his course.",

I guess his lectures were hampered by the size of the class. He would always seem to be in a hurry to cover as much material as he could without really caring whether students understand any of it or not. Like many others, I had to rely on online lectures from Stanford to build a proper understanding of many concepts covered in the class.

The TA's are hit and miss - there are one or two that are good and will actually try to help, but the rest aren't that great.  I'm pretty sure one of them never actually held office hours.  He just sent out an email that he was canceling every week.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was a really strange incident that stuck out at me: on one of the homeworks one of the TA's announced they thought there was a lot of cheating going on, as they got a lot of almost identical submissions (something like 40 out of 130ish students), and their response to this was to take a few points off the grade of any student with one of those suspicious homeworks who asked for a regrade.

Between meeting once a week and spending half of the class time on a dubious \"design\" project, we covered only a few topics, and only at a cursory level. The selection of topics was ok: identity based encryption, bilinear groups, byzantine agreement, differential privacy, fully homomorphic encryption, and obfuscation. However, there was no unifying theme; some of these topics are barely even cryptography. I felt like I learned a few neat cryptographic schemes, but did not come away from the class with anything else. There were no assignments aside from working on the design project. We were given papers to read; however, they were simply too long and hard to read in their entirety. I would have much preferred problems to do or more material to read on the basics. Because there were no assignments or exams, no one tried particularly hard to understand the material.\r\n\r\nThe project mentioned above was to design an interactive protocol for key-exchange. The project was well-motivated: we read an attack paper that described a real-life attack against an existing scheme, and started brainstorming how to circumvent the problem. However, after that, we got kind of bogged down. A handful of student presented ideas, but after that, progress more or less halted. Yet we still spent half of the class re-hashing the problem.\r\n",

                "content": "A really interesting computer graphics class with an amazing professor. In this class, we are given a glimpse to the realm of geometry modeling and geometry processing. As we live in the age that artists and product designers utilize 3D software such as Rhino or Maya or ZBrush, to digitally model their products before actualization into tangible objects, or to model cartoon characters that would appear in animated films, this class provides a great introduction into the technical aspects of how these 3D softwares work or should work. We study the fundamentals down to the level of so-called NURBS curves and surfaces, geometry processing performed on triangle meshes, and subdivision surfaces -- each with extensive mathematical backgrounds that consider how these structures give artists and manufacturers computational advantages such as desired degree of smoothness no matter what shape of the curves/surfaces are formed. It is a really fun experience to learn how design softwares are actually made of, and we also had a guest speaker from the industry to discuss how he actually uses the software to design real-world products.\r\n\r\nSo the class covers mainly three parts: the fundamentals of B-Spline curves and surfaces (as well as NURBS and Rational form), geometry processing (in particular, mesh data structures and mesh simplification algorithms), and Subdivision surfaces (e.g., Catmull-Clark). Each topic has extensive assignments associated with it to help us see how things are implemented. Some are really challenging, but Prof. Reed would give us extensions if needed. So we always have time to refine our assignments as possible. I'd say I'm very proud of the code I have done for this class, since they never look like a mess compared to other classes that I sometimes rush things through just to make it work. It's so organized, and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the professor, he is probably one of the best professors I've had for Computer Science class, personality-wise. He really took time to answer individual emails and discussion threads. He modified his assignments plan as the semester went, so we were given more challenging works since we did well as a class on the first few assignments, which helped me to learn even more. He was very approachable during his office hours or after class. So in a sense, you never feel isolated or helpless in this class. The only caveat is that his lectures sometimes may be a bit dry, but bare with them, and you will go a long way.\r\n\r\nSo, even with a slight interest in computer graphics in general, I'd recommend you to come and take the class, and you will be amazed how much you learn and have fun at the end.",

The course covers curves and surfaces.  He covers bezier and b-spline curves.  He also gives lots of examples in class and goes over it in detail.
