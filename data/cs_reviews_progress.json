However, this dude cannot teach a class because he just doesn't care. He is extremely condescending and sarcastic and treats students as if they are below him. On Piazza, one student asked a simple question regarding the grading of the exam and he responds \"Have you even seen your grading yet..I think not!\"\r\n\r\nClass is spent by going over videos of robots, dissections and reading through the slides in class verbatim. It's not too big of a minus since I feel like most of the professors at Columbia do the same, however his slides are unnecessarily long and are packed with irrelevant information. \r\n\r\nThe midterm is easy (avg. ~75-80) as he was obviously too lazy to change the questions from his sample midterm (that he only hands out in class), but the second midterm goes so in-depth in material you once thought was irrelevant the average turned out to be 30 points lower (avg. ~55-60). He also was too lazy to give out a sheet containing answers to the \"practice\" midterm, which was nothing like the second midterm. In other words, the exams are highly unpredictable so try to memorize every single thing you see on the slides. \r\n\r\nThe homeworks require you to use the ROS software which is actually quite glitchy and can get frustrating at times. There is not a lot of guidance for these homeworks, so good luck hacking your way through it!",

The course no longer deals with programming real robots (thank god), so it's all simulation. MAC USERS BEWARE: You will need to purchase the Parallels software (about $40) in order to run the Linux VM for ROS;  Virtual Box is not nearly powerful enough to handle the simulation. The lectures do not help at all with the homework (its basically sink or swim with learning ROS and RViz), but the lecture material is what you will be tested on. \r\n\r\nI have to say, I\u2019ve never had a professor who was as mean-spirited and condescending as Peter Allen. I don\u2019t know why he is such a negative man; my only guess is that he is in the middle of a nasty divorce. He doesn\u2019t care about the students, and has displayed astonishingly little concern for whether or not they succeed. He actively discourages questions by mocking or snapping at the asker. He trash-talks the TAs when they're not in the room. I want to like this class, but Allen's attitude really detracts from it; if he were a little bit more pleasant and helpful, it would make the class worlds better.",

BUT WITH THAT SAID...\r\n\r\nI strongly disliked this course with Allen for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) A good chunk of the homework was focused on Java GUI's as opposed to actual data structures. There was minimal to no assistance in constructing these GUI's, which meant you had to spend large chunks of time scanning tedious API documentation to try to figure out how to do things, instead of spending time actually learning and implementing the data structures. Also, I found this frustrating because Java GUI's are increasingly becoming an antiquated form of user interface in industry, which spending the time to teach them to myself seem irrelevant. In my opinion, it would make a lot more sense to include extensive implementation of Java GUI's in W1007.\r\n\r\n2) Professor Allen is actually condescending to students. There were numerous Piazza posts where students would ask questions that were fairly reasonable and his responses would be incredibly and unnecessarily snarky (i.e. Student: \"Can we assume ___ about problem X?\" Professor: \"Can we assume gravity exists?\"). In class, this attitude discouraged students from answering/asking questions.\r\n\r\nSomething I love/hated about the class was that his lectures were literally him reading through his class notes, which were posted on the course website. This meant that going to class always felt like a waste of time (you could literally not go and just read the slides and be fine), which was simultaneously awesome and terrible.\r\n\r\nOverall, I do feel like my knowledge of data structures has improved since the beginning of the course (specifically with Trees and Graphs), but if I could do it again, I would definitely take this course with someone else.",

Allen only gives you a general overview of what might be on it, without a practice test, and the questions on it are weird; often testing cursory knowledge of subjects not covered in any assignment or project. It felt like the final was \"trying\" to be harder than the rest of the class just to achieve a nice grading curve.\r\n\r\nThat said, here are the pros:\r\n\r\nYou get to program for an actual, real-world machine, which is something you don't really get to do in many other classes. It's a different kind of debugging when you have to find out how slippery a certain floor is and factor that into your motion calculations to account for drift. \r\n\r\nYou also get to use linear algebra in a very practical way, (It really cemented a lot of the fundamentals I had only weakly grasped after taking intro to Linear Algebra). Lastly, it also serves as an intro to Computer Vision as well, some of the later homework assignments require you to mount a camera on the robot and do image processing to solve certain puzzles.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it's a class that kind of feels like an easy-A class despite having a respectable work-load (the projects) and arbitrarily difficult exams. Allen is a lenient grader for the projects, but not for the midterms. This is definitely an \"application\" class, not really a \"theory\" class. Take it if programming a Roomba sounds like something you would like to do; for all its flaws I enjoyed it well enough.",

In fact, we went over most of the graphs stuff in this class before Discrete Math. So don't worry about taking both classes at the same time,\r\n\r\nThe class covers the basic data structures and the algorithms associated with them. Most of the codes are provided by the textbook, so you don't really have to memorize how to write them, but you do need to know how they work. Most of the questions on the test and the hw require you to apply an algorithm to a set of data and show their results. The materials covered are not too difficult, and as long as you can think abstractly and understand what you are trying to do, you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nProfessor Allen is an excellent lecturer who presents the materials very clearly. He uses powerpoints for the lectures and every time we get to some code, he would stops and demonstrate how it worked on the blackboard. His lectures notes which he posts online are concise and super helpful. The lecture notes extract the things you need to know from the textbook without going into excessive details and get boring, as the textbook tends to do. In fact, I almost never had to use the book other than to do the assignment from the back of each chapter. You can get by on his notes alone without going to class or read the book, but I highly recommend you to attend the lectures when possible because he actually explains everything in details.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were not difficult. There's usually a couple of questions from the back of the chapters and 1 or 2 programming questions that'll take you about 3 to 6 hours if you know what you are doing and maybe 10 hours if you are really lost or have little experience in programming. The programming assignments mostly involved implementing the psudocodes he gave in class and put it in a real use, which I really enjoyed. \r\n\r\nIn summary, it's a (surprisingly) light class with a great lecturer and awesome notes.

                "content": "I took Data Structures & Algorithms during the Fall 2009 semester, which was taught by Peter Allen.\r\n\r\nThe Course:\r\n   On the whole, I think Data Structures & Algorithms is a great course that gives CS students a solid grounding in how to think about solving computational problems in ways that are efficient with respect to time complexity and memory usage.  While I learned a lot from this class, I think it would have been possible to make it slightly more advanced than it was.  There was a fair amount of overlap with the data structures component of COMS 1007 and, in my opinion, not enough time was spent on learning more complicated algorithms and data structures.  Nevertheless, at this point, I feel that I have a solid understanding of all basic and intermediate DSA, which is of course extremely critical to success in CS.  My only other complaints about this class are that the homework assignments were a bit too easy (or at least were graded as such) and that the programming assignments all required GUIs, which ended up requiring more time and effort to implement than the algorithms themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Professor:\r\n   Professor Allen is an excellent lecturer who does a great job of making sure that the concepts that he's presenting are clear and that the students have thorough exposure to how a particular algorithm works.  I read an earlier review that said that Professor Allen can be an asshole who berates students for asking questions/giving answers.  While I must say that there were a couple exchanges that Professor Allen handled in a bit of a confrontational way, I think this was unintentional, and I think he really does care about his students and their success.  He is also a very funny guy, so I think sometimes his humor is such that his jokes could be construed as reproaches.  He is very helpful both in office hours and over email.  Additionally, his handouts are so fantastic that I anticipate using them as reference materials for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe TAs:\r\n   While generally I don't think a TA's contribution to a class merits review (positive or negative), I believe that Dan Federman warrants an exception (positive).  First of all, as a recitation instructor, Dan was very good at both reviewing things that Professor Allen had gone over during lecture as well as delving deeper into certain topics that were either not discussed at all in lecture or were merely glossed over.  In addition, I found Dan's recitations to be extremely helpful when it came to clarifying the details of our various assignments.  DSA required every assignment to be implemented with a GUI, which could have proven to be exceedingly burdensome were it not for Dan's ability to explain the finer points of Java AWT/Swing.  Dan's recitations were effective not only as a consequence of his intelligence and knowledge of the subject, but also because of his ability to present material in a very dynamic and engaging way.  Secondly, from an administrative standpoint, Dan was incredibly responsive when it came to fielding questions about the logistics or the substance of the course.  Finally, Dan made a point of putting the class into a \"real-world\" context by discussing the kinds of applications the various data structures might have or by going over what sorts of DSA-related questions might come up in interviews.  This information is invaluable and was extremely helpful.  I am taking CS classes at Columbia as a postbac, and so I have had plenty of experiences with TAs as points of comparison.  Having said that, I can honestly say that Dan is as effective a TA as any I have had in my academic career.",

Also, get comfortable when he starts to walk through an example, because he'll take you through the WHOLE thing, even if the process is the same in the first 10% of the example as it is in the last 90%.\nIf you take this class, be prepared to work. This was the most work I've ever done for a class. Ever. The theory questions are usually reasonable, but the programming is killer. It wasn't uncommon for me to spend my entire weekend working on an assignment (even with no procrastinating). There's a lot of work, but I think it was worth it because after you walk out of that class, you will be extremely well prepared for programming in Java and comfortable with the data structures discussed in class.

He may not take any bullshit, but he hands it out in huge buckets by making his students write Swing interfaces for every assignment.  So when do you write the actual *data structures and algorithms*?  You don't -- you copy the textbook's code, then stay up 'till 5am writing 5000 lines of JFrames and JOptionPanes.\n\nI've tutored literally dozens of Allen's 3137 students, and the only thing they seem to have learned from him was bad coding style.  It's not all his fault -- if the CS dep't is going to use Java, then 1007 has to teach the basics of OOP.  Yet almost no students come into 3137 understanding the basic concepts of abstraction, and Allen goes out of his way to make the situation worse.\n\nFor example, here's one absolute law: Keep the data structures and the GUI in different classes!  If Allen were really a no-BS kinda guy, he'd give zero credit for anyone who put Swing code in their Stack, BST, etc. classes.  As it is, his 3137 is a lesson in producing awful hacks.  Laying your code out in a clean, maintainable way is a THOUSAND TIMES more important than blindly adding Swing objects to an ADT class until something appears on the screen.  But Allen requires none of the former and oodles of the latter.\n\nThis the kind of class that makes people hate CS.  Compare it to a really successful and challenging course, like MIT's 6.001 or even Gross's Discrete Math here, and you see how we're shortchanging our students and turning potentially talented programmers away from CS for life.  This course is worse than useless.  Yes, Allen is a contemptuous waste of time, but he's just a symptom of the stale status quo in Columbia's CS department.",

Prof Allen does not really curve, and if he did it didn't affect my grade much. He did drop the lowest HW, which was predictable as he repeatedly mentioned that you could afford to mess up one HW. Allen has little patience for BS, so don't ask him stupid questions, don't stand in front of the room, even to grab a handout, when he's lecturing, and don't tell him he isn't teaching the material we need to do the HW -- he practically tore one student apart when he was asked for techniques used for hasing. The student felt we weren't given enough options to meet his desired # of collisions, and Prof. Allen practically walked him through all the examples in the book. Come to find an email in all our mailboxes later that his required max number of collisions was off by a factor of 3. Oops. Basically, if you start early on the assignments, this class will be very rewarding and will help you progress greatly as a coder. Allen makes learning the material incredibly easy, as his lectures are so easy to listen to. But if 1007 was difficult for you and you're really not getting Java, start every assignment the day you get it and hope it all starts clicking soon.

I asked for an extension because I was sick and he didn't even ask for a reason but only ask me to email him to remind him about it. I don't really remember him being mean to any students except a time when a couple of students were standing right in front of him when he was lecturing so he asked them to walk away so he could teach. I don't think that was undeserved. Otherwise I think it's just his lecture style to sometimes be sarcastic and blunt. He doesn't bullshit and he doesn't direct his attitude to students. Therefore so far as I'm concerned he's a great teacher. The TAs, though, were somewhat irresponsive. They generally did a really fine job answering questions about the materials. But with administrative stuff like grading policies and grade statistics, they always told us to ask another TA who would tell us to ask another one, or simply ignore our questions altogether.",

Unless you have a photographic memory, you are not going to do well. The midterm's questions were based on less than 1% of what was covered in the lectures, textbook, and articles he asked us to read. For example, 20% of the test was based on one random paragraph from one of the many articles. Another 20% was based on a topic he spent literally 5 minutes talking about during a lecture. Why is this a bad idea? It rewards students that have better memories or, to a lesser degree, that happen to get lucky because they studied the 1% of material that shows up on the tests. Studying for Feiner's tests is essentially a game of roulette, but with much a lesser chance of success.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and Flash Builder 4 is terrible.\r\n",

He tries to be a good guy (I guess) by telling you how to prepare for exams and then says \"do all the [voluminous, outdated] reading and review your class notes,\" as though that's helpful -- and then asks a couple of questions on the exams that are calculated to punish all but those who memorized the course material. 40% of the midterm, for example, was based on a topic covered by 3 pages in the text and a couple of his slides -- all of which seems faintly  sadistic.  The individual HW's were interesting; there could have been more of them. The team projects, as always, were an aggravating waste of time.

It is a field that is completely ignored in ALL other classes, and it is quite important. Unlike most courses in the department  it actually practical and applicable to anything you'll ever program. I do agree with all previous (bad) reviews. However, the problem with the allegedly harsh grading of the homework is that most of the grade is not based on functionality. Your program may follow all specs, but still get a C. It is the USER INTERFACE that gets you most of the credit. And you can only start thinking of user interface AFTER you completed all specs, which is usually around 5am the night before it is due. And that is truely a big problem with this class. But as you know from the previous reviews, you get some penalty-free late days to use on any combination of the first 3 (!!!)assignments. Another major problem is that there is a lot of reading, and it is all asked about in the midterm and final. As a rule of thumb, if there is a formula of some sort in any of the papers, it will appear eventually on a test. You will probably have to state it and explain it. Nothing too fancy, but you do need to memorize a bunch of them like it's a high-school history test. Not the end of the world, though. \nIt is true, this class feels more like a Humanities class that a regular CS class. You have to read a lot papers, and there are never problem sets (only programming projects with minor explanations of \"why did you choose the interface that you did\"). It is, though, not the hardest class you have taken or will take in the department, and it opens a window to a very neglected (and again, practical) area of compters. Lets face it, in the real world, your boss/client is much more likely  to care about the interface of your program. And like in this class, they are going to take the functionality as a given.",

At least, that was my impression until I stopped going to class. His lateness policy is a breath of very cool fresh air -- thank god, because the assignments themselves are poorly designed and students are ill-prepared for them. Like in some other comp sci courses (ahem, OS), you get the feeling that the professor and TAs started out with very ambitious assignments that they were going to prepare students for -- until they forgot to do the preparation part. But even that may be being overly generous, because the net result is inexcusable: students have no clue how to approach the programming, and TA office hours (again, so much like OS and other high-level CS classes) turn into unofficial cheating sessions where beleagured TAs have no choice but to disseminate crucial information (that the rest of the class doesn't get). I don't know if Feiner and his TAs even realize how much potential for learning gets thrown out in the process. And while there may be worse professors in the department, that doesn't make Feiner good.  The bottom line?  Steer clear.",

If you do the reading ahead of time as Professor Gross recommends (and which I did for the first 7 or 8 weeks), lecture is a good review of the reading plus a few new examples Gross works through and alternative problem-solving strategies he suggests. If you don't do the reading ahead of time (me for the rest of the semester) lecture is a waste of time. It's absolutely impossible to keep up in lecture because there are so many definitions, propositions, theorems and lemmas that if you're seeing the stuff for the first time you'll get completely lost. As I said, it's what you bring to it.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that this class is basically a math class, not a CS class, and the tests and homeworks are designed accordingly. They emphasize mathematical intuition and spacial skills more than regurgitating examples from the book in condensed form. Attacking some problems by brute force alone is basically impossible*, but if you can manipulate the graphs in your mind's eye just right you'll see the solution. In the final third of the semester this became somewhat less true because the final chapters of the book involve algebraic topology, which as the name suggests involves solving equations.\r\n\r\n*The best example of this is a question on the 2nd to last homework that requires you to find the 48 vertex automorphisms of the octohedral graph. If you do it by brute force, you'll never finish. A few friends and I spent a combined total of 12+ hours that way. But if you're a bit more systematic (e.g. finding the stabilizer for a given vertex, then composing some permutations with each other) you can solve the problem in 2 or 3 minutes.",

                "content": "Quick note: This class is most definitely a mathematics course. There are basically no concrete applications of the material covered and certainly no programming involved.\r\n\r\nProf. Gross is arguably the most idiosyncratic professor you'll ever meet. And that's definitely a good thing. His lifelong love for topology and graph theory (and their intersection) is clearly evident in his lectures, in which he wanders off into reminiscing about his early mathematical career and some tidbits from math history and algebraic topology. This \"sidetalk,\" as he calls it, makes the class more interesting and is, as a result, an integral part of the course. Integral.\r\n\r\nGross's lecturing differs from other practitioners of the overhead-projector style because the projector doubles as a slideshow of ever-evolving course notes and a whiteboard in which he goes through examples with the class. This is probably because he has walking problems (he comes into class wearing sneakers and holding a cane) and the fact that Graph Theory is a CVN course. I wasn't really able to appreciate his usage of the projector in Discrete Math because it didn't seem necessary (small examples, mostly numerical manipulation), but once we hit graph enumeration, it became clear why Gross preferred the projector: it's basically impossible to fully draw examples otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe course is by no means an easy course like the pre-req Discrete Math. While the graph theory section of Discrete Math was limited to basically one type of problem (\"find a Kuratowski subgraph\"), this course requires much greater ingenuity. The homework assignments' problems range from trivial input-numbers-into-formula questions to somewhat difficult proofs, and the tests are filled with mostly the latter. While the homework sometimes feels like a drawing exercise, the tests are filled with original and clever problems. \r\n\r\nI felt that the breadth of the material covered in this course was especially exciting, though keep in mind that this makes the course go at a very fast pace. But just keep up with Gross, because it's totally worth it.",

Almost certainly my favorite class this whole semester, but I can't quite figure out why.\r\n\r\nGross is absolutely brilliant -- there's no question about that. He just radiates a sort of aura of genius while he lectures. The class inevitably brings up questions about things that are peripheral to the course material: the incompleteness theorem, decidability, complexity, topology -- Gross can explain it all. But the CS department here is full of brilliant people, and none of them have (yet) inspired the same kind of reaction from me that Gross did.\r\n\r\nHis lectures and course notes are fantastic. Clear, concise, elegantly typeset -- you could learn all the material from only reading the online notes, or from only going to class and reading nothing at all. But Blaer is a great lecturer, and Allen's notes are just as good; again, I never looked forward to either of their classes as much.\r\n\r\nHe's digressive, but...actually, I don't think there's another lecturer in the department quite as digressive as Gross. And maybe that's the point. When your question about the well-definedness of negative moduli launches a fifteen minute discussion of how humans understand made-up words (and no answer to your question), you're learning. When you're treated to a lengthy description of the mechanisms used to solve the four-color problem or the Poincare conjecture, you're learning. The main content of his lectures teaches you discrete math, but the digressions teach you to think like a computer scientist.\r\n\r\nI think CS students here have a tendency to underestimate the usefulness of this class. If you are planning on doing anything in real computer science (and to a certain extent, even software engineering) discrete math is absolutely crucial. If you can't put together a proper inductive proof, you can't do CS Theory, and you can't do Analysis of Algorithms.  If you can't reason about graphs, then you'll never really understand what's going on in Data Structures or in Networks. I would have been helpless on the first Linear Algebra homework this semester were it not for the tools I picked up in this class...you get the point.\r\n\r\nThis is powerful stuff.

Class generally consisted of working through the pre-distributed course notes (the majority of the time) and solving several problems (the last 10-15 minutes). He also threw in historical notes and occasionally a crazy story or two about some of the more famous graph theorists/algebraic topologists (many of whom he has worked with directly). The course notes basically re-packaged the material from the book (excellent, by the way, and co-authored by Gross himself) into a lecture-friendly format. My advice would be to read the relevant chapters in the book before class.\n\nThe six problem sets were generally difficult and time-consuming, but they will drill the material into your head. Perhaps more importantly, the problems will teach you how to think like a computer scientist. Some of the topics in graph theory have few real-world applications, but they train you how to attack and solve complex problems in mathematically rigourous ways (which is much more important than any application). In any case, Dr. Gross and the TAs (Josh Reich and Lawrence Hon) held plenty of office hours and were always very helpful. The tests were difficult, but he said they were designed to have mean of about 60 and were curved accordingly. Also, the tests were open book/note/whatever.\n\nMy only caveat is that graph theory is a somewhat fragmented subject with its own peculiar dialect. Dr. Gross has an amazing command of the material (and the dialect), so, while his explanations are always excellent, you must undertstand his language or it'll sound like gibberish. Don't slack off in the first few weeks; if you master the early material, you'll be in good shape when the more advanced subjects come in.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this class.",

His main problem is borne of his love of the subject - I think it's tough for him to relate to people who don't understand the material, so he has difficulty packaging things in a friendly way.  In fact, the material, both in the course notes that he teaches from and in the book, seems to have no regard whatsoever for the idea that mathematical concepts needn't be articulated in obtuse shorthand that caters to experts, not students in a class with the barest of prerequisites.  If you're having trouble with a concept, you'll probably have to see Prof. Gross in office hours and see one of the TAs and spend some time curled up with the book.\n\nProf. Gross teaches directly from course notes that he posts on the class website.  You should consider it pretty much a requirement that you print out the course notes before class and bring in the printouts to write on.  Otherwise you'll be scrambling to write stuff down in class, and you'll miss most of it.  If you print the course notes and read them and the assigned chapters in the book before each class, you'll have a much better idea of what's going on during the class.\n\nThe problem sets and exams are quite difficult.  You can count on having to run crying to the TAs on at least some of the problem sets, so you should leave time to do that before they're due.  Prof. Gross says he writes the exams aiming for a class average of about a 60.  They're open book and open notes though, so that helps.  He posts some old exams, so if you can do those very well (and you should, as practice), you'll be fine.\n\nIf your final average is in the high 70s, that should earn you an A-.",

I don't mean this in the sense of practical applications of the material (though the training in combinatorics has certainly been useful in my current research), but important in a larger sense.  Professor Gross's goal is to make you (in his own words) \"become your own expert\"- to teach you how to approach problems creatively, and with maximum rigor.  This class was probably the most influential one that I took in all my undergrad education.  You may or may not appreciate his jokes, but I strongly encourage people to take the class.",

The homeworks are a joke as the solution manuals solve similar problems (only the numbers are changed around). The exams are also pretty easy as they are open book and open notes. An overly dumb SEAS contingency lowers the median so as long as you score about 95 or so on each midterm and the final, you are set for an A+.\n\nGross himself doesn't care if you learn the material, as he is not too available, but the TA's are somewhat better (they are like his bodyguards).",

I am a math major and only took the class because of the material covered in the class.  However, Prof. Gross is completely inept.  He has this attitude that he is a math genious and if students are naturally inclined in math they will understand his lectures, if not, tough on the student.  I agree that this course covers a huge array of topics and the class is very time pressured, but Gross makes minimal attempt to lecture well.  His notes that accompany the book are absolutely horrible and worthless (I learned the material from the book which is actually a very well written text).  Half of Gross' lectures are anecdotes from his life: he has told us numerous stories when he was a kid and how brilliant he was in math and other information about his life.  Also, he never writes on the blackboard (I have never seen this done especially since this is a MATH course...).  He explains the concepts poorly and rushes through topics that are very important (I guess I can't totally blame him for this since the syllabus is very dense).  However, he expects the students to understand all material as if we spent days on each topic.  For example, in my 4000 level math class it took us 40 minutes to go over Cantor's proof for the uncountability of real numbers, but somehow Gross showed us the same proof in the last 2 minutes of class.  All I know is that if I didn't previously see a lot of the material taught in this class I would be completely lost.  A lot of the material seen in this class is covered in a lot of the higher level math classes and I find it hard to believe Gross expects the students to understand the material at this level.  Now, onto his tests.  I have never taken a test that is so off topic with the material covered in class.  His tests only test you on your natural grasp of math and minimally tests you on the information covered in class.  I learned after the 2 midterms that I could have studied for another 30 more hours and not have received a higer grade.  For example, his problems seem at first glance a straight forward easy problem.  However, there usually involves one tricky step that has nothing to do with discrete math (it usually has to do with \"seeing\" a shortcut or something like that).  Each question is similar to that: you either see the trick or you don't.  If you don't see it, you will probably will not be able to start the problem and receive 0 points on it (and this hurts since the test consists of only 5 or 6 problems).  Overall, (and I really do hate writing negative comments for a professor) I would say run as fast as you can from this class.  If you do not need to take this class as a requirement then don't.  I found this out the hard way.",

So I am just going to talk about stuff that is unrelated to the title to the class. And he does exactly that. There are 3 seperate materials that one learns: the stuff that he takes about in class, the actual material from the book, and the stuff that he puts on exams (which is basically, mathematical riddles). About the exams, he says that they are intentionally difficult to have a wider distribution: \"I'd rather have a range of A's from the 70s and above so that I can distinguish between the very good students and the exceptional ones.\" The truth is that if you've got \"it,\" he is an enjoyable professor. Since the class is curved, the median is a B anyway, even if it is 50/100 or lower.",

They took their complaints to Piazza almost every time an assignment was released. Although I personally disagree and think it\u2019s fine as an intro class because it is an HONORS class, I want to point out what the students felt like at the time. So do expect the class to be really challenging. The assignments will take a huge amount of time. It is almost impossible to do them a night before (unless your goal is to only pass). The exams are not particularly easy but they\u2019re not insanely hard either. If you just study the lecture notes and skim the book and assignments you\u2019ll be fine. My only complaint is that sometimes the questions on the exams are vague or open to interpretation but the professor wants a specific answer in mind, and if you don\u2019t write what he wants, then he marks it wrong. However, like other reviewers pointed out, the curve is enormous. A raw final grade in the high seventies will land you an A or A- depending on that year\u2019s curve. He\u2019s also not that intimidating as he seems, but actually very approachable and nice. He always asks for feedback and even gave the class an extension once (don\u2019t push it though). ",

                "content": "This review may not speak to the content of 1007 so much as the culture, but I would like to note to incoming students that this class has a surprisingly pre-professional and competitive atmosphere. I remember on the first day, Kender listed a number of languages - Perl, Python, C++, and asked students to raise their hands whenever they heard a language with which they had experience. I immediately felt so lost; I'd signed up for the course knowing just what was required to take it. I was, in fact, prepared for the course. I'd taken AP Java in high school; I'd done well; I for the most part continued that trend in 1007. But there wasn't a moment of this class I didn't spend questioning my abilities or worth as a CS student, even when I did quite well on the assignments. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot of things Kender could have done to abate or eliminate this competitive aspect of the class, but instead he seemed to constantly make choices that worsened it. First of all, he'd post a list of the naked grades (everyone in the class' grades stripped of names) after every assignment. Seems whatever, but he did it in a way that each row would represent a person, and each column their grades on a particular assignment. To me, this seemed like an overabundance of information; Kender could have released the mean and perhaps standard deviation for each assignment, like most CS classes do, and that would've been enough information to know your approximate standing in the class. Second of all, after every naked grade set was posted, some guy would post in-depth stats on Piazza on the grade distribution, which was pretty unhealthy, grade-focused BS. I wish Kender had shut that down.  Third, at the end of the class, Kender sent an email to all students naming those who got an A+, as well as saluting certain members of the class who he felt had made significant contributions (like Piazza posts etc.). This is something I've never seen a professor do before -- if you do well in a class, you should know it without the professor emailing all your peers. The email also privileged certain modes of achievement in a field that, right now, desperately needs a diversity of thinkers and personality types. I'm not saying those students that Kender singled out don't deserve praise; but it would have been much more appropriate had Kender kept those thank-yous and A+s confidential. \r\n\r\nThose are just, to be clear, a few select examples of a trend of competitiveness that pervaded this class. Oh, and by the way, after all of this Kender had the nerve to complain (in that same final email) about how our class seemed more pre-professional than usual, as if he hadn't contributed at all to the atmosphere. When I read that, I actually laughed out loud. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the course itself, I have few complaints. The material was truly interesting, and genuinely helpful to me as a programmer. Kender was a great lecturer, happily supplied all kinds of interesting supplementary information on Courseworks, and patiently explained concepts in person and on Piazza (even on the weekends). The class was difficult at times, but I learned so much about good design and feel like I have a great grasp of object-oriented programming now. I find myself applying design patterns + strategies I learned in this class all the time. In fact, I can't imagine where I'd be as a programmer without 1007. That's why it's such a shame that the class atmosphere was so unwelcoming. I'm not asking for hand-holding, but I don't think it's unreasonable to request an environment where the professor isn't implicitly supporting a culture of \"who's best\" or \"who's worst\" or \"what's the grade distribution\" or \"who wants a professorially-sanctioned way to brag about how much they know about multithreading even though it's mostly irrelevant to this class.\" Anyone who signs up for Kender's class and sticks with it has already demonstrated they deserve to be in 1007, even if they didn't get an A+ on homework 3 or couldn't work up the nerve to raise their hands that one time in lecture.\r\n\r\nTake this class and ask a lot of questions; what you'll learn is worth it. But do your best to block out the competitiveness, and know the class is not representative of what CS culture should be.\r\n",

In fact, this was evident from our midterm scores - the curve had two peaks!\r\n\r\nThat said, this was an exceptionally well taught course thanks to Professor Kender. This man can teach. Kender is truly silver (possible gold) nugget worthy. While the content of the course was not the best, (not Kender's fault - he has to comply with the CS department) Kender did an amazing job at teaching it. His lectures were a joy to attend. He is organized and methodical and teaches in the order of the chapters in the book. He has a great sense of humor and tells at least one awesome joke per class. He also gave us lots of cool extra information because this is \"an honors class\". Also, he has this strange, but fun obsession with the Principle of Least Surprise (PoLS).\r\n\r\nDon't let Kender's imposing figure scare you. He is a very approachable and reasonable professor who will take the time to help you out. If you're too intimidated to ask him a question in person, there's always the online solution. This course used Piazza which was great since it allowed us to ask questions anonymously and clarify doubts in the assignments. Kender is on Piazza almost 24x7 on the weekends before assignments are due.\r\n\r\nAssignments were of variable difficulty and length. Many of them were poorly worded causing some confusion. Some were very interesting like making a GUI game to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock with an AI engine. The assignments were usually graded within a week or two. The TAs were for the most part good. One TA (name not disclosed) was very stingy with grades and always screwed the assignments he graded. This unfair grading affected some very unlucky students.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were long but manageable. Note down everything he says in class. His tests mainly consist of questions from topics discussed in class, especially violations of PoLS. Grading was extremely fair - not easy, not hard. He takes a long time to get exams back because he corrects all of them himself (and he unfortunately had an ill member in his family this semester). He gave us candy canes during the final because glucose apparently stimulates brain activity. Needless to say, that was the most entertaining exam ever.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you have a strong foundation in Java and design, skip this course. But try to take Kender whenever you can. He makes this course worth while with his godly teaching prowess and great sense of humor.",

In class, this leads to him calling on several people before he hears exactly what he wants to hear. He often gets exasperated at people not saying the right answer immediately. What's important to note is that often the right answer has been said, but he just didn't notice because he was too fixated on having it said exactly how he thinks it should be.\r\n\r\nThat's how it was on the exams as well. Clearly, he thought of the answers before he thought of the questions, and didn't spend much time thinking about how to phrase the questions. They were completely incomprehensible. On the midterm, he even gave us all an extra 8 points because he admitted that one question was so terribly convoluted. On the final, the chalk boards were covered by the end of the exam because of how many changes he made to the directions. I must have lost 20 minutes going back and redoing stuff because he was redefining the questions as we were taking the exam!\r\n\r\nThe work load is enormous in this class. Again, the questions were often ambiguous. If you badgered him on the discussion board, he'd sometimes clarify things. He also didn't check the API before assigning some of the graphics stuff. I must have spent 20+ hours combined trying to work around bugs in the API to try to make my designs the way he wanted them. I even sat down with him once in office hours to read through some unofficial API source code, given that his response to one of these bugs was, \"Hmmm...that's unexpected...\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was the most frustrating experience of my semester. If I didn't have to take it, I wouldn't have. I don't feel like I learned that much (except for some interesting stuff in chapter 7 about generics). I feel like if Kender had been focused, it might have been a semi-enjoyable experience. He was too much in his own head and didn't interact well with students, though.",

He made me care so much more about the class, and I went to every single one of his lectures.  He really knows his material and clearly explains everything.  He is more than happy to clarify any questions, and is very approachable, though he may seem intimidating at first.\r\n\r\nI was impressed by the level of attention he gives to his students.  With the assignments, he tries to give as much help as he can without giving away answers, and provides a lot of interesting and relevant supplements and anecdotes.  He is an extremely fair grader and though the class is difficult (generally, most the students are engineers), it is curved.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend taking this class just for the professor.  He encouraged the class to attend talks and such around campus and to take advantage of all opportunities provided by the university.  He is not only an amazing professor, but an amazing person and makes you feel he cares, even if you've never spoken directly with him.  He clearly has a passion for teaching, and I would seriously recommend holding off taking 1007 a semester to be able to take it with him.",

But since he is too intimidating for any students to just walk up to him and hug, he penalizes us by giving us incredibly challenging (but fun) assignments.\r\n\r\nHis lectures, most of the time, grabs your attention and doesn't let go. The only boring parts would be the ones where he tells us about the necessary evils of memorizing idioms. Even those, however, coupled with Prof. Kender's otherwordly sense of humor and enthusiasm, are possible to get through completely awake and conscious.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are quite difficult, yes, and many people dropped the course halfway through because of a certain assignment. (It personally took two all-nighters in Butler.) But if you enjoy computer science at all, the challenges he throws at you and the sense of accomplishment that you get when you finish will be enough to keep you going throughout the entire semester.\r\n\r\nFYI, don't worry about the numerical grade that you get. Prof. Kender grades hard on all assignments and tests, and the numerical grades may seem low. But the letter grade won't be; for example, the B+ on the midterm was in the high 50s.\r\n\r\nIf you have a chance to take this man's course, do not let it pass on by. You'll regret it.",

Lectures were very well-structured and easy to follow without being simplistic, and although the material was occasionally a bit dry (idiom memorization is not exactly thrilling), Kender's understated and offbeat sense of humor kept things interesting. He puts the material into perspective--the class is taught only in Java, but he explained the language's current (and rapidly shrinking) place in the field and how it differed from other languages (often in the form of deadpan disparagements). While he spent a good portion of the first few weeks of class waiting for students to answer questions, eventually the class began to respond and lectures became more smooth and interactive. Despite a scant four-month programming background, I felt comfortable with the material largely due to the clarity and thoroughness of the lectures.\r\n\r\nWhile the first assignment was difficult, Kender polled the class on our experience and modified the next assignment based on the responses (similar polls happened after all assignments and the midterm), which I really appreciated.

As for the workload, don't try to pull all-nighters before the assignment is due. It's possible, but you'll hate your life. You have two weeks to work on them, and it's a smart idea to spread things out over that time. This course convinced me that computer science was not for me. Kender is a great professor, so the only reason that I didn't like the course was the material. I did the work, and was happy with my grade, but the other students in the class would make crazy additions to the assignments for no extra credits, and I'm just not willing to study a subject where the other students care that much more than me.",

I was planning on studying oceanography and/or atmospheric science for grad school, so I thought the 'Physics of Fluids' would have been the ideal preparation. Moreover, Mauel is renowned to be one of the most enthusiastic lecturers on campus (he really is) so I figured this class has to be a hit. Boy, was I ever wrong. \r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this class is that Mauel almost never uses the chalkboard and teaches solely from his scanned notes. He compiles his poorly written notes into a powerpoint and lectures with the aid of a smartboard. Each slide is packed with a ton of information, mostly equations with very little comments, and he crams about 45 of them into a single lecture. For an 1hr 15min lecture this works out to be a minute and a half per slide. Unless you have had a lot of exposure to the subject and/or have an IQ of 250 you will have a difficult time learning at the pace at which this man teaches. As a SEAS student, I have grown accustomed to drinking from the so called fire hydrant. The usual remedy is to simply read ahead of each class but that brings me to my second biggest gripe: the text book.\r\n\r\nMauel uses a textbook by Kundu and Cohen, which is quite frankly the worst textbook I have ever used. It claims to be an introductory text but assumes that you know all the jargons of the subject. The book is as readable as a phonebook and not nearly as organized. Mauel follows the book for the most part but the chapters usually go beyond the scope of what's covered in the lectures. Needless to say, learning from this book is very difficult. The book does cover 'everything', so by the end of the course you'll find that it serves as a decent reference. For learning purposes, I had to borrow a few books from the library which turned out to be a life saver. \r\n\r\nMy final gripe is with Mike Mauel himself. I really like this guy. He is as brilliant, enthusiastic and entertaining as people say he is and he really knows how to spark the class's interest. However, he doesn't seem to put much effort into his lectures anymore. He essentially recycles the same set of lectures every year. Even the stuff on courseworks had dates that were 2 years old. There were many instances were he forgot what a slide was about, fudges the explanation and fingerjabs the smartboard to go the next slide. He also doesn't give out past exam questions to prepare for his exams. He claims it's too much work to come up with new questions. He didn't even go over the midterm with the class.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you have a good amount of exposure to fluids, a solid physics background and solid math background up to partial differential equations then this class can be manageable. If you are like many people and are without said exposure and background, your learning curve will be very steep and you will have to put in a lot of work to keep up with the class.",

The topics we covered this semester were Kepler's Laws of Motion, Randomness, Data Compression via Fourier Transforms, and Quantum Mechanics. If none of this sounds remotely interesting to you, this course is not for you and will be a 3-hour weekly waste of your time. You also should not take this course if you have had no programming experience. Mauel hardly goes over the basics of Mathematica, and introduces new constructs and functions with only a passing statement. If you really want to know what your code is saying or want to create really cool/intricate projects, you will have to spend some time learning Mathematica code by yourself, which will be a bigger challenge if you haven't taken AP Comp Sci or COMS 1007.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if you are interested in these topics and understand (fairly) simple programming concepts such as loops, arrays, and modules, this course will be worthwhile. Mauel is a fantastic and very enthusiastic professor. I don't think I've ever had a teacher as enthusiastic about his/her subject as Mauel is. It's also stunning just how knowledgeable he is in such a wide range of topics. He is also incredibly helpful on a one-on-one level, so do yourself a favor and take advantage of this: talk to him after class, email him, and schedule office hour visits. \r\n\r\nHowever, he does tend to move quickly at times, and if you are lost at the beginning of a topic.. you'll be hopelessly lost until the end. And this brings up a major problem of the course: it doesn't really have a purpose. It doesn't go nearly in-depth enough into the topics to give you a full understanding of them, there really isn't any programming he's teaching, and you don't really learn Mathematica. By the end, it's just one large copy+paste festival to get a project complete on time. \r\n\r\nStill, if this course sounds interesting to you, take it for a week or two, see what you think. If you don't like it after three weeks or so, drop it. It won't be worth your time and effort. ",

Sometimes he'll even exclame: \"Isn't that cool?!\" I sincerely hope that I can take another course of his before I graduate.\n\nI had no real programming experience before this class. I had worked a little with computer algebra systems before, but not extensively. This course gives a broad introduction to the world of computational science. It makes use of Mathematica, which is installed in all the computer labs. The topics vary from year to year, but expect to see some of the following:\n\n* Orbital dynamics\n* Chaos theory\n* Fractals\n* Digital signal processing, e.g. image/audio compression, filtering\n* Protein folding\n* Quantum mechanics\n\nEvery week, Mauel gives an assignment that incorporates much of what was discussed in the last class. All the files are available for reference and often all that is necessary to complete the assignment is to copy and paste the code from the class notebook into the homework notebook and modify the code a little. You don't need to be a programmer: just pay attention in class and don't be afraid to ask Mauel for help. He is extremely helpful and understanding. Mathematica has detailed help built-in for every function. Information can be looked up very quickly.\n\nIn addition to homework assignments, the class has 4 projects to be completed through the term. There is no final exam. The projects are like harder homework assignments. If you satisfy all the basics, he'll give you an A. If you really put in the effort and do something original, he's happy to give you extra credit.\n\nOf all the pre-professional courses, this one may be the trickiest, but you'll learn a lot of really cool stuff and Prof. Mauel is a fantastic teacher.",

Mauel is so energetic in class that it's obvious he really likes this stuff, and he's so willing to help you out.  The TA was also extremely helpful.

If you're a physics guru, this class is certainly for you. Otherwise, you should really consider taking another pre-professional course.\n\nAnyway, Professor Mauel is the most enthusiastic and friendly teacher I've seen in Columbia. One can easily tell that he's genuinely interested in what he's lecturing: will you jump and exclaim in delight when you talk about Kepler's laws? I won't, you probably will not, but Professor Mauel will.  He's also friendly and he doesn't mind giving you personal, step by step tutorials on how to complete your assignments. You can e-mail him your mathematica programming codes, (Oh, this class is all about mathematica and programming, if you don't know C++/ Java, you'll be in a great disadvantage)  tell him your problem, and he'll tell you his suggested programming codes usually within 24 hours. Also,  he's willing to sit next to you in front of the computer, teaching you how to  solve the problems.  What else can you ask from a professor?",

Most other operating systems classes are almost entirely theory focused and their assignments barely scrape the surface of the essence of OS. In Professor Nieh's class, the six homework assignments work to build a story for your OS understanding. This class is hard, but the value in learning is extremely high. \n\nThere is really no way for anyone to gauge the true difficulty of the class based on reviews. Yes, most of the reviews here say that this is an extremely challenging class, but that materially doesn't really mean much until you are deep into the class. This class is challenging, but with proper warning and preparation, I don't think it is impossible at all. There is SO much help provided for this class, more than I have ever seen for a class. Office Hours everyday of the week (except Saturday) with extremely well-versed TAs, and an Ed Discussion Board where TA's respond within a few hours max. If there are reviewers saying that this class is impossible or that they needed to self-study material, they probably did not utilize office hours.\n\nDon't take this class if you aren't interested in systems programming.\n\nWarnings and Advice: \n1. Take this class seriously. It's three credits, but has a really high workload. I took this in a semester where I only took four classes total and it was still a stretch for me. \n2. You need a good team. You can switch your team every homework, so don't hesitate to do so. This is not the time for being nice. Focus on your learning. I personally switched my team twice and it ended up being okay. They say the limit is three people to a team, but the assignments are doable with two people that have good communication and drive. \n3. Put the ego aside, go to office hours. So many people refuse to go to office hours and waste an unbelievable amount of time trying to get something to work, only to get low grades on the homeworks (me early on). The TA's are extremely helpful, and so are your classmates! OH is a great place to work on homeworks too, since its a pretty collaborative environment. Again, reviewers that say they had to self-teach themselves, probably did not go to office hours.\n4. The homeworks are not one-shot-able. You will need the two weeks. You can \"get things working\" in a few all-nighters if you procrastinate, but you definitely won't get the grade you want in that case. \n5. Exams are pretty difficult to actually study for. The best thing you can do is review homework solutions and try to think about what each part of each homework aimed to fundamentally teach you. \n6. You need to have really clear C fundamentals. You will read significantly more C code than you will write, but in both cases you should be able to read, understand, and write C well. \n7. Lectures are extremely important. It can be difficult to follow tracing kernel code in class, so definitely rewatch lecture. ",

He switched things up about halfway through the semester and seemed to focus more on illustrating concepts on the blackboard, which was a lot more useful.  The exams--not sure what the point of them is.  The median scores are like 30/100, so apparently if you don't answer exactly as they expect you to, you'll be getting a failing grade, even if you did okay on the homework assignments and understood the concepts.

That being said it is also the greatest course I've ever taken and I would 100% do it again if given the chance. \n\nThe course teaches you (surprise!) how a modern operating system works, using Linux as a case study. You'll read and modify the Linux source code so you walk away not only with an understanding of how an operating system works but how to modify the Linux kernel for your own projects. Now, that sounds cool (and to be honest it is) but this leads us to the fact that the inherent difficultly of the course lies not in the subject matter, but in the sheer volume of material you need to learn in 4 months. If you are considering taking this course, you should be a) be VERY comfortable coding in C (if you did well in AP and understood the material you're good to go) and b) taking a light course load. On the second point, I'm a SEAS student who took 4 classes the semester I took OS, and they were all relatively easy. I still ended up having no free time as I was always either working on the homeworks for OS or the homeworks for my other classes.\n\nThis brings us to the homeworks (Oh God). There are 6 total, and typically you get 2 weeks per assignment (I say typically because towards the end of the semester he gave our class some extensions on the deadlines). Starting with homework 2 you're put into groups of 3. Be sure to choose a good group, but more importantly, if you get a bad partner, SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ONE NEXT ASSIGNMENT. Trust me, you don't want to go through this course alone, look out for yourself. Be prepared for a lot of stress, confusion, and late nights. Once you get to the middle of homework 3 it's not an exaggeration to say you'll be working 30 hours a week on these. Homeworks 1(writing a minishell) and 2 (something with task structs) are easy, homework 3 (process state changes) is the hardest in terms of difficulty (plan to drop this homework), homework 4 (writing a scheduling class) and 5 (something with page tables and memory) are easier than homework 3 conceptually but still have heavy workloads, and homework 6 (file systems) is easy (note this homework will be easy only in comparison to the previous homeworks, this would still be pretty difficult in a normal class).\n\nNow to the lectures. One of the only reasons I think people tolerate the insanity of the course's difficulty is the fact that Jason Nieh is an amazing professor. He's a great lecturer, and by the end of the semester you'll have internalized all of his catchphrases for explaining linux source code (drinking game idea, take a shot every time he says \"under the covers\"). In the inevitable event you don't understand something from the homework, go to his office hours. Not only will you get help on your assignment, you'll get to discuss the homeworks with other people in the class, because everybody shows up to his office hours.\n\nIf you're debating taking OS, the most important thing you need to know is if you love systems programming. And I really mean love, because only love can prompt a perfectly sane individual to dedicate all of their free time and happiness to writing a custom page table that's >1000 LOC only to get a 17/100 because you forgot to build for ARM architecture (unfortunately true story). That's not to say you can't have doubts, but if in the first two weeks you're only moderately interested, drop the class. Like the quote above indicates, OS is the Hell. That's not just my experience, it's like that for everybody. But it's 1000% worth it in the end. You'll make friendships based of shared trauma that will last a lifetime (the friendships and the trauma), you'll get a great understanding of how personal computers actually work, and you'll walk away an incredibly strong programmer. OS is long and hard, but if you stick with it it'll lead you to Heaven.",

Regardless, it was a great experience, and towards the end, it wasn't even that bad! Professor Nieh is a very clear lecturer that is incredibly knowledgeable about the material and established in the field. He is also very friendly- GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!! The material itself is not too difficult to grasp, and the two textbooks, OSTEP and LKD are very helpful. I also thought the material was pretty interesting- I felt like I finally understood what my computer is doing on a foundational level. I also particularly enjoyed Professor Nieh's lectures where he goes through examples of synchronization on the blackboard, as those made the difficult concept quite clear. As many of the previous reviews pointed out, Professor Nieh likes to go through Linux source code in class. Those lectures can be quite boring and confusing if you haven't looked at the source code beforehand or started the homework, but once you're caught up, they're usually very relevant to the homework.",

However, this year, he changed Homework 3 and oh my god, those 2 weeks spent on Homework 3 were the most arduous 2 weeks of my life at Columbia. Nothing worked. My computer froze unpredictably and intermittently. Google didn't help. Stack Overflow didn't help. It just didn't work no matter what we tried. But after that brief 2 weeks in hell, my understanding of the material improved drastically, so much so that Homework 4 did not feel difficult at all and ultimately, our Homework 3 was dropped. Aside from Homework 3, all the other homeworks were challenging but pretty interesting. I definitely felt frustrated while doing them, but never bored. In addition, the homeworks taught me how to use git version control, how to understand a large codebase, and how to collaborate with others, all of which I believe will be helpful later on. \n\nAlso, the exams are very, very, very tough because you have to write code on them. I am pretty sure our final exam had a ~30 average. But the curve is generous and if you make sure you understand the homework solution code, you can't do too poorly.  "

                "content": "Well, I've always heard other students saying that OS is the hardest CoSci course in Columbia. So, I'm like, well, since I've taken most of my required courses, so why not give OS I a shot? And oh boy, all these rumors about how hard this course is are real...\nThis class is the HARDEST 4000 level course I've ever taken, it's like CLT plus advanced Algo plus complexity theory plus Computer Networks(by Prof Ethan, of course). So yeah, that kind of hard. AP, analysis of Algo I, and lots of other CoSci courses which are labelled as challenging basically becomes...trivial in front of this one. So, please consider carefully before you enrolled this one, or else it will drop a GPA bomb on you.\nSo yeah, do not take it unless:\n1. Your track requires it, well then it's no escape here lmao\n2. You really likes OS\n3. You are a C-language god and knows how to do kernel programming. Well under this case, be my guest, take it:)\nOh btw, even if you have to take OS, if you are a master student, you should take it at the last semester, where you only need to take two courses. This course has a workload of 2.5 courses, so yeah, don't take it when you're enrolling 4!\n\nDon't get me wrong, Prof.Nieh is very good at teaching. He knows how OS(specifically, Linux here) works, and he delivered course contents crystal clear. If you found something vague and unclear, you can easily get your answer by ganking the Prof after class, post an Edstem post or just read the textbook. So conceptually, it was not that bad.\nAlso, the grading process of this course is also very fair. There will be auto testers plus manual review of your submission with clear rubirc. So it's unlikely you got point deducted without a proper reason.\n\nAt this point, you might ask, oh so what make this course so hard? Well, its workload and complexity of HWs.\nThe first one is about writing a simple shell. You just need to make sure it perform just as what the statement defines. Watch for memory leaks! Don't Malloc without freeing things. Valgrind should be very useful here. I mean, you've taken AP before and you better know all of this without me telling you here, or you're just not ready for OS.\nYou should aim for 95+ when doing HW1. Trust me, if you didn't do well or find it too hard for you, you probablty should drop this course. Having a good grade in HW1 will 'pull up' you a little bit in your final grade calculation.\nThe second one should be implementing a system call. It will take a while to compile for the first time. So I suggest you to compile the given skeleton code as soon as it was released. Same rule applies for all following assignments. HW2 is hard, but not hard at all if you compare it with following HWs. Make sure you understand all these Linux and C language conventions, such as Linux List head and all these Macros. They will be very useful:)\nAlso starting from HW2, you will work with a team of 3. You need a WORKING TEAM, which can be either a team without slack teammates or a team with at least one god-tier carry who seems to spoke C language in his/her/their daily life. If you didn't get a good team for HW2, either you can rush it out with your own wisdom(it's still possible for HW2), or you gonna scew up, which is kinda of fine at this point. However, for ANYONE who wants to do well, or at least decent, my rules are:\n1. Get a working team!\n2. Get a working team!\n3. Get a working team!\nYou want to cut steak with a plastic spoon? NO YOU DON'T! I cannot stress more on this. They'd lock me up in an asylum, yet I'd still say, \"GET A WORKING TEAM!\" So yeah, if your HW2 screwed up cause your team does not work, DUMP THEM IMMEDIATELY. Prof.Nieh approves this, you should write an email to him politely, and he will arrannge you a new team. If that does not work. Repeat the dumping process. Don't afraid to be an A-hole in this class, trust me, a non-working team will make you feel much worse then just dumping them. Don't trust your teammates \"Oh I will do better next time\", THEY WON'T and YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THE RISK. Thus, unless you yourself is a god-tier teammate, eject immediately when you feel something is off.\n\nOk, back to HWs. HW3 is likely to be a HW on state of processes, preemptions and threadings. Start early on this one! Or else you might get your first 30/100! Well, at least you can try to figure things out by browsing through linux source codes. \"Source codes are ground truth!\", said by Prof.Nieh. Also, try to arrange your teammates s.t. for any OH during the week, there will be at least one guy in your team be there and querying the TA. TAs are extremely helpful(or else how could we survive through this course?) and you SHOULD ASK THEM QUESTIONS. Your codes does not compile? Ask TAs! You got a Null-pointer-Exception? Ask TAs! You got some unexpected Core-Dump? Ask TAs! Trust me, AT should be a solid rule you follow, just like RTFM. And it's gonna helped you a lot.\n\nAlright, assume you survived through HW3 with a working team, HW4 is about scheduling, and believe it or not, it is not that hard(comparing to 2~6). Linux scheduling classes are pretty much...OOP, so I think it is really not that bad. The only crappy thing is, you might not be able to boot if you mis-write some codes. Hence, make sure you use snapshots of your VM software. Trust me, you don't want to re-install your instance, re-compile for one hour just because you wrote some code that broke your previous VM instance. Otherwise, you should actually aim for 80+ for this one.\n\nOk, here comes HW5. It's likely to be one about memory paging. Remember I said you should get familiar with Macros, well here you gonna use them a lot in order to walk the page table. Again, start this one early. Prof.Nieh might allow you to submit this HW after the Thanksgiving(If it's fall term). But during Thanksgiving, there will be NO OH held by TA/Prof. Thus, finish it early, or good luck trying to figure why this/that page fault/seg fault occurs by yourself.\n\nHW6 is about Filesystems. It's a long but not that hard one. However, at that point, you will have tons of upcoming final and due on final projects. Hence, a working team is really important here! Tell your teammates not to bother using crappy excuses such as 'oh I have a final so I cannot do anything'. EVERYONE IS BUSY DURING FINAL WEEKS AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE. Don't feel defeated when you open files provided by TAs and found them to be completely empty.(Very cool man, actually giving out a skeleton code without any bones.)  Try to make progress everyday and you are likely to survive through this final HW.\n\nAlright, so much with HWs. Now, time to talk about exams. THEY ARE HARD. If you found sample exams to be easy, IT'S A TRAP. Make sure you re-read assigned chapters s.t. you understand conceptual questions. More importantly, review previous HWs! It's likely there will be coding questions which asks you to modify some previous HWs. If you screwed up some of previous HWs, make sure you read solutions! I would say that solution codes given by TAs are hard to understand, as they might made changes to Linux Kernel in multiple files across different folders. So, make sure you spotted all of them and understand why. TAs are likely to use some Linux Kernel functions that are not covered during lectures, you will want to gank them during OH and post Edstem posts s.t. you can understand what happened. Understanding HWs will help you at least average in exams, thus please take my word on this.\n\nIf you read through all my previous writings, well I wish you good luck. The fact that this course is only 3-credit while AP got 4 is such a joke in my POV. Have fun writing Linux code and I hope you got an A.\nIf you are one of OS staff and is reading this, I suggest you re-consider adding some short sanity check HW on system call implementation. Throwing HW2 on student's face is not that a good idea, most students are not prepared. A sanity check HW will be a good warning as what's gonna come next.\nMerry Christmas:)",

                "content": "Given the last review for Professor Nieh was written in 2013, I figured it is worth to share some more thoughts on this class.\r\n\r\nThis class is everything they say it is. Nieh will teach you everything you need to know about Operating Systems, and then some more. His lectures are fast-paced, dense and sometimes difficult to keep track of. However, he is a very good lecturer with an impressive command over the material. He will answer several questions during class, which sometimes gets frustrating as he digresses. If you pay attention, you will learn a lot, but you will often have to back up the concepts with the textbook to actually master the material.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the homeworks. Oh God. Nieh will talk about the concepts in class and he will talk about the homeworks a little bit, but to be honest, you are all alone. They involve writing code into the Linux kernel. Not only do you have to read A LOT (I mean, A LOT) of C code to figure out what you need to do, you also have to be really good at C to actually implement what's expected of you in a reasonable amount of time. Expected to spend 10 hours figuring out what you actually need to do before you write a single line of code. Expect to actually skip homework on other classes to finish these assignments. They will make you a great coder (especially if you want to be a systems programmer), and you will actually master reading Linux source code by the end, but it's a ridiculously rough patch. You will also have to demo your completed homework to a TA after it is done.\r\n\r\nHere are the breakdown of each of the programming assignments:\r\n   - Writing a bash shell. This one is the only individual programming assignment and also the only one not involving kernel programming. It is probably the easiest to do, but it'll still take around ~10 hours to finish. I see this more as a weed-out assignment for the students who aren't as confident in C.\r\n   - Writing a system call to keep track of Android's interprocess communications. This is the first time you will write code for the Linux kernel and also the first time you will write a system call. It's not actually that difficult, but takes a lot to get used to the programming environment.\r\n   - Writing an interface that sleeps selected Android processes and makes them wait on designated light intensity levels. The main emphasis here is concurrency / synchronisation. Starting from this assignment, you will actually be using a physical Android device, which Nieh makes you buy. Expect to pay a total of $200 as a group of three. \r\n   - Writing a process scheduler for Linux. This is easily the most difficult assignment in the class. Most of the teams actually didn't do it and dropped the assignment. My team spent over 30 hours and still got a failing grade. I'd still recommend you to attempt it, since you may be tested on the homework.\r\n   - Exposing process memory to the user. This is the assignment that has to do with memory and paging in Linux. Conceptually can be a pain to figure out, but it's not actually a lot of lines of code. There are some weird Linux-related bugs which slowed us down, so expect to find hacky ways around them.\r\n   - Writing a file system for Linux. This wasn't that bad because the TA's set the homework up pretty well, but just like all the other homeworks, it's again a lot of time.\r\n\r\nDon't expect the grading to be nice because the homeworks are hard. We were constantly tested on weird edge cases that we didn't think of. Nieh expects the highest of you despite how difficult it is to even set up the groundwork for a lot of these assignments.\r\n\r\nTA's: Some are very good and some are very bad. Don't expect office hours to be helpful, they are overcrowded and if there are students scheduled to demo their homeworks, you won't get to even ask questions.\r\n\r\nTextbooks: There are two. One is very helpful for programming for the Linux kernel, especially early on. The other is helpful for the written components of the homeworks and for studying for the midterm and the final. If you could get one, get the Linux programming one.\r\n\r\nBoth of the tests are also difficult, with class averages around 50-60 percentiles. You may be asked on anything you did for this class, from the lectures to the homeworks.\r\n\r\nFinally, grading is OK with a mean around B+, but you leave feeling it could be more generous given how much work and patience this class expects of you to even get a score around the mean. Despite all of that, if you do your work, you will learn an incredible amount about operating systems, C, Linux, systems programming, concurrency, and even more.",

Prof. Jason Nieh teaches the course very well.\r\n\r\nApart from the skills and experience in the areas - Operating Systems, Linux kernel programming, this course demands a lot of your \"C\" skills.\r\n\r\nIf you are a HardCore \"C\" fan and would love to experiment at system level in \"C\", then read on!\r\n\r\nThis one class is for those who crave for \"C\" programming a lot! You will get your hands dirty while building crucial features of Linux kernel on an Android device in \"C\" involving Synchronization, Scheduling, Paging, File Systems, etc(as per the projects in Fall 2012).\r\n\r\nYou will fine tune your \"C\" skills yourselves mainly in the area of optimizing the usage of the kernel resources in terms of memory. You keep an eye on what each function ends up returning to determine its success or failure - this comes with practice if you aren't in the habit!\r\n\r\nThe grading rubric is the most comprehensive one I have ever seen in my life. For each of the assignments/homework, the rubric would cover every nook and corner cases that a novice \"C\" programmer for Linux kernel would definitely ignore.\r\n\r\nWell, in the beginning you would find each of your submission being bitten by checkpatch, for not abiding by Linux kernel coding style. But, with time, your \"C\" coding style becomes smooth and elegant if you start respecting what that seemingly strict master(checkpatch) says, trust me!\r\n\r\nAh, userspace programs for each of the assignments! Well, I enjoyed much by dwelling in \"C\" while building the user space test programs for testing the Linux kernel features implemented in each of the assignments. You would be asked to demo each of the Linux kernel features you would implement in each homework and during the demo, well, how dedicated you were in testing your code gets rewarded when the standard test code(which they would have in their repositories) completes without any problem and you hear TA saying, \"That's cool!\".\r\n\r\nTAs were very helpful in answering the questions we had. Sometimes, we had to bug them and get the information what we want - but, they were all nice and had good hold on the subject. Among them, I found through live and piazza discussions, TA - Alex to be damn good in the subject.\r\n\r\nI feel it's important to mention that the solutions they would publish are simply beautiful. The solutions implemented by Christoffer Dall were mesmerizing. No, am not exaggerating at all - his coding style is so pleasing to eye and his code looks very simple and precise!\r\n\r\nPeer reviews: Yes, you would get opportunities(or responsibilities?) to review and grade other people's code. Here, I was annoyed at certain times of seeing some seriously senseless code from other people. At other times, I had also the chance to look at some brilliant code. So, overall, there was a good exchange of knowledge and suggestions between our team and various teams.\r\n\r\nYeah, btw, try to form a good competent team - believe me, it's better to have arguments and come up with some kick-ass code which scores beyond the average code resulting from an average interaction or no interaction at all between you and your teammates. And this is from my experience!\r\n",

His classes are great, even if you miss in person, you can view them on CVN later.

Best resource to get help is good TAs. For our course TAs were really good and helpful. I spent almost few hours with them before doing any assignment and it helped.\r\n\r\nCool thing about this course is that if you do assignments on your own and are able to finish it, you will become good enough to answer any question on kernel that you are expected to know and even more.\r\n\r\nMake good teams for your assignment. If you have problems with team mates better change team, hire or fire someone else you will end up struggling alone and that doesnt help.\r\n\r\nJust remain above average in exams, assignments and your grades will be great.

Work not so hard and, well, you'll know the theory fairly well, but that's about it. This class requires a highly intimate knowledge of C--if you don't know it very well, then either skip the class or be prepared to read the K&R book thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe course covers the internals of the Linux kernel and we worked specifically with 2.6.11. Nieh covers mostly theory in class, and there is one text which goes over theory in more detail, and one which is a god-awful dry textbook (more like a manual, actually). The assigned readings aren't that long, and you will definitely need to do them--otherwise you will have no idea what the hell is going on. That being said, his lectures compliment the readings very nicely. Nieh was one of my better profs in terms of not \"teaching out of the book.\" However--Nieh is the person you go to if you don't understand theory. If you need help with the homework, skip him and go to the TAs directly (he has little involvement in the homeworks).\r\n\r\nFor each homework, you write a patch to the kernel that does something. After you submit, you have to meet with the TA for ~30 minutes to demo it, and they will also run their own test program on it. Be careful as they are NOT AT ALL forgiving if anything goes wrong--if you can't get it to work (even for a stupid error like you submitted the wrong file), you lose practically all points. Also, each HW has a written portion (~10 questions, usually 50% of the grade).\r\n\r\nHWs:\r\n1. Basic stuff, write a small shell, etc.\r\n2. syscall logger: not that hard, just an introduction to syscalls/the virtual machines you'll be using\r\n3. waitqueues/locking/threading stuff: you don't have to write that much code, just be careful what exactly you write.\r\n4. implemented a new scheduler type. most of the class just skipped this HW entirely, i recommend you give it a shot, but, don't bother if you can't get it.\r\n5. memory tracker: write a syscall that can track what chunks of memory you're using. requires you to go low-level with page tables, etc. tough but doable.\r\n6. process tree filesystem: make a filesystem that reflects the processes on a system. it's a lot easier than it sounds; he gives some examples of other pseudo filesystems in class.",

That said, the programming part of the homeworks was arduous and time-consuming (yet rewarding once you gradually grokked a solution, which ended up being less than 50 lines of code for most of the assignments). An able CS undergrad would spend anywhere between 10 to 20 hours a week on the homeworks (written + programming parts combined). Nieh's lectures are very straightforward, and they are very much worth attending. The class is all about *detail* -- for those in systems, there is mounds of it to drum into your head, and this class gives you good practice. The worst part of the class is not the homework, but the morons that you can be potentially be paired up with for doing the programming assignments.  Your partner may contribute nothing, yet s/he can get all of the credit for your hard work.

If you can't keep up with the homework, then you are basically screwed. The programming part is **all Linux kernel hacking** and it is *not* covered in class. Don't expect the TA's to debug your problems and don't expect the prof to give much help except conceptual stuff. Of course, if you have munched Linux kernel code already, then this course will be a breeze. BTW, the cheating policy is outrageous (if the TA suspects you in the least, you are screwed.)

However, be prepared to spend ample of time on projects and homeworks if you are planning to take this course. He doesn't make jokes in the class and not a very dynamic professor. Another negative side is, sometimes he will just introduce with a new topic briefly and then he will make suck a homework problem or project that you will need to learn everything by yourself to confront it. Having said that, he is very approachable and if you are lucky then you might get some good TAs to use some help from them. I would say, it's not a dead hard course and it's possible to get good grades if you work hard. Also, if you are good with logic design fundamentals then it will be smooth. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested to work on digital logic design/ hardware design, then I would recommend to take this course.

For some reason, Prof. Ross seems convinced that the course \"self-selects\" smart people, that those enrolled in it are naturally highly critical/creative thinkers.  This may have been true for past offerings of this course, but I did not find it to be the case when I took it.\n\nOut of 22 students, maybe 8 regularly produced creative, original ideas and could competently implement them.  Most of the others were pretty average, while a few people were just plain dumb, lazy, or both.  This may sound harsh, but when you find yourself teamed up with one or (gasp) two of these people and have to think through an inventive problem solution, code it, and write the final report all by yourself, you *will* feel your urge to kill rising.  Also bear in mind that all members of a group receive the same grade, and there is no formal peer review process.\n\nI still recommend this course; it has several important merits that others have mentioned, and what you learn in it will stay relevant long after you forget the intricate details of distributed transactions or lambda calculus.  If you put in the work, you will walk away content unless, like me, you don't suffer fools gladly.  If you don't put in the work, you will still do relatively well at the expense of those who do.",

There are four projects across the term (each covering about 3 weeks).  There are 5 discussion classes per problem (in which the class demos their latest solutions and discusses their approaches), and one class where each group presents their report.\nGroups are randomly determined, but you can request to work with particular students (but you can only work with each person on ONE project).  The groundwork for the problem-solving has been done for you - the TA provides the class with a simulator program and the interface for your code to use, so you can dive in and typically write a simple/naive solution to the problem in twenty minutes or so, leaving you most of the project time to create and implement more complex solutions - there is almost no setup work.\nThe class works on full disclosure and full sharing - you can take any code you find online and use it, as long as you say you did, and you can rip off your classmates as much as you want, as long as you credit them for what you ripped off.\nOne of the great things about this class is that it brings you into a group of some of the best minds currently studying at the school.  It will have you thinking differently about all sorts of problems.  The other great thing about the class is how I always left the discussions wanting to work on the project - unlike most classes where the assignments are fairly arbitrary, you have a great deal of leeway in the deliverable, and typically you have something you want to try.\nI would recomend this class to anybody who feels comfortable with a discussion-\noriented problem-solving case study.\n\nAlso, I would reccomend Professor Ross' databases course - he is an excellent professor.",

He has a habit of mishearing questions, and then answering them, but if you persevere, he has the patience to clear things up for you.

He clearly has a great depth of knowledge in the field, his digressions are good, and he's very personable and approachable.\n\nSome things to be prepared for, though:\n\n* His lecturing style is very dry, delivered in a low rumble. I was really interested in the material and was able to look past this to some extent, but it was sometimes hard to keep my mind from wandering. It also meant that much of the class wasn't all that strongly engaged, which de-energized the room.\n\n* The lectures were fairly applicable to the exams, but weren't all that helpful for the homework assignments. This, in combination with their dryness, plus the online availibility of lecture notes, is probably what caused most of the class to stop going to lecture starting about 1/3 of the way through the semester. This de-energized the classroom further.\n\n* Professor Yemini tries to make the initial assignments harder and the assignments later in the semester easier; his feeling is most C.S. classes operate in the opposite manner, and it's nice to counterbalance that. This isn't a bad philosophy.\n\n* There's a definite effort to make the homework assignments and the exam questions non-cliched and interesting. The results of this are a bit hit-and-miss, though. In the first programming assignment, for example, it was very difficult to divine what the project was supposed to do based on the specification. Others in the class spent hours upon hours spinning their wheels until they understood; I settled for a lower grade on that assignment. The second programming assignment, an RMI MUD server (with a reasonably constrained world-state to keep track of), in contrast, was a lot more fun.",

Eugene Galanter is clearly a genius-or incredibly skilled at imitating one. This course however, can best be described as \"muddy\". His lectures are a drag, and without any statistics background they can be tremendously difficult to follow. Often I just ended up typing whatever I could catch, and staring at my notes in frustration and terror at the end of the day/week/unit. On the first day he puts a simple equation on the board and suggests that it is all the mathematics you need to know to do this course. Technically, he is right (I mean, I did it), but be prepared for much much more difficulty than that particular equation suggests. The lectures often digress into anecdotal chatter about Galanter's personal history, all of which is amusing and interesting and impressive but has nothing to do with the material. However, you cannot skip them entirely because often times a few questions on his thirty-question (or so) quizzes are pulled from sentences he uses in class. Verbatim. The readings are much more central to the quizzes (which I agree are really 'exams') but it is impossible to keep up with the syllabus because it has nothing to do with Galanter's lectures. You will be reading cute stories about Freud's youth long before he touches on the topic in class, which brings me to another point about the readings: they're scattered, and a large portion is anecdotal (like you cared about Pavlov's wife?). Furthermore, they're on CD, so if you're like me and prefer to highlight and make notes on the reading you'll be printing like a mad woman. If the INTENSE stack of readings you must review for the quizzes isn't enough, the TAs occasionally add some more on courseworks (and yes they pop up on the test). Of course, the oft-complained-of format can be a bit annoying but isn't impossible, my best reccomendation is to review your quiz three times before you hand it in (if you show up on time for it you'll have plenty of time to do this and still leave early) and of course, just make your own notes off of the readings. You can do well in this, but you will not enjoy it (and may break down and cry in the night's previous to the exam). Honestly, despite my respect for Galanter, you will end up frustrated and bored. If you're using it for the CORE, take it with a friend and try and split the workload. ",

As a result, many students received minus deviations throughout the semster. According to one of the TAs, the lowest grade in our class on the first test was a -40. Example questions that Galanter may ask are: \"Pavlov is to Fechner as Frued is to...,\"  \"If X is the total number of students comprising Columbia's student body and Y = the total number of females under the age of 20, what does N represent?\" And to the reviewer who says that Galanter curves final grades because he got a B+; I also received a D in this class.

                "content": "To start with the most important thing, I am glad that I took Science of Psychology with Galanter.  That said, I don't think he's for everyone.  Some of the lectures were quite vague and difficult to understand.  He went off on tangents and told bizarre stories.  The TA's during the review sessions (which were held during normal lecture time the class before the test) were far better at lucidly explaining the material.  The readings (Galanter's own books) were... a little hard to get through, but provided some entertaining writing and good information.  The worst part about the readings was that they came on CD, and there were very few pictures and diagrams (I sound like a kindergartener), and I think for a course like psychology that could've been helpful.  That's the thing, the class didn't really feel like a science class.  That may be because I had the wrong impression of what psychology is going into it, but needless to say it didn't feel too scientific.  I came away with a decent grasp of what psychology is, but my favorite part of the course was just hearing Galanter's rants.  He is clearly a brilliant man, and he's been around.  He received his PhD from Penn in the 50's if I remember correctly and has worked with some of the brightest psychologists of all time.  He himself was quite a scholar in his day.  So, spending some time in his world was fun.  The grading was based on three heavily curved multiple choice exams with the gimmick that you choose the three wrong answers instead of the one right one in order to receive points, to discourage guessing.  Did I mention they are open note?  I missed a lecture or two, took decent but not fantastic notes, and copied the relevant material from the readings (which we were allowed to do) the night before and cruised to an A+ in the class.  I'm not sure if the people in the class were that dumb and/or were thrown off by the \"select the wrong answers\" instruction, or maybe I'm just that smart, who knows, but I thought it was an easy class.  Your mileage may vary.  In summary, I'm not sure if I learned as much psych as I could've from another teacher, but I think the unique experience of hearing Galanter ramble combined with the ease of the course made it a good choice.",

Rather than select the 1 correct answer, you are supposed to cross off the 3 out of the 4 incorrect answers.\n\nThe review sessions held by the T.A.'s prior to each quiz are useless.  The handout they give you which lists all of the topics and historical figures you should know to prepare for the test will simply be a waste of your time if you adhere to it, because half the topics on the review sheet won't even be on the quiz.\n\nThe lectures are terribly boring, with more than half the class not even showing up anymore after the first quiz and those that do either spend the 75 minutes IM'ing or playing solitaire.  If you're lucky, every once in a while Galanter will crack a joke that is remotely funny but most of the time you will be bored to tears as he simply regurgitates from his own writings which are all circa 1962 and written in a fashion that make even the most intelligent student at times feel like an idiot.\n\nMy advice:  don't walk, but run as far away from this class as you possibly can.

The guest lecturers and the TA lead review sessions make you realize how little you're learning and the horrible test scores pretty much across the board would lead you to believe they would have to curve (keep dreaming).

He gives 2 of the 3 quizzes and the grades for them before the end of the drop/add period and a boat load of students leave the class. I didn't drop after the second quiz because I could not afford to lose the money and my Dean said that the science classes at Columbia don't get much easier than this. I have to disagree with my Dean. There are much easier science classes if for no other reason than that there are professors who coherently teach 80-100% of what will be on their tests. This intro level class was a traumatic, anxiety ridden experience. He is a founder of cognitive psychology -- I guess that's why he is still teaching but he should just be writing books and doing some sort of research. He doesn't belong in a classroom. \n\nGood points : They return the grades quickly--usually within 2-3 days. The TAs know most people are struggling and are available to help you understand things. You get credit for your scores improving -- at least you did this semester. I don't know how he is going to change his policy next year. \n\nAdvice: If you have to take this class, when you take your quizzes leave all questions of which you are not sure of the answer Blank -- I know this is hard because we are use to being know it alls who answer all the questions but leave it blank. \nAn unanswered question is your best friend. \n\nI got a B+",

It is obvious that only the students who \"aced\" this class are the ones attempting to elevate Galanter from a pompous piece of garbage to the level of a human being. What you should bear in mind is the huge number of students - about 50 - who withdrew from this section. Among them were a number of  psychology majors. I know this for a fact as 3 psych majors withdrew from our study group. Galanter's \"readings\" consist entirely of books that he has written. Bear in mind: Galanter's books are geared towards his contemporaries in the psychology field - NOT undergraduates. There is no logical cohesion between lectures, the texts, and the syllabus. If there is a topic or formula that is unclear to you, then good luck finding an answer.  Galanter tells the class: \"Direct all questions to the TAs.\" The TAs in turn, were just as lost as the students. Originally there was to be a disucssion section, but Galanter decided that it was unecessary. After all, every student is well versed in statistics, as well as fluent in Latin. Which are required to understand several of the formulas.  Personally, I think the glowing reviews about Galanter's class were posted by the TAs, or Galanter himself. Galanter will most likely  remain in your memories far after the class ends as THE WORST Professor you will have at Columbia. I realize the intense negativity I am imbuing into this review, but it works to balance out all of the unfair \"positive\" repsonses on this class. If you are thinking of enrolling, ask around for feedback on Galanter. I am certain there are more students with hatred for this man, then there are with love.",

Contrary to popular opinion, the most valuable part of 1001 for me was the readings.  Not all were the most interesting, but holistically they form a pretty good overview of the subject's basic areas of study.  Galanter's choices are about 50 years old, including the ones he wrote.  WIth a few exceptions they were very easy to get through, if not the freshest of material.  Given the course's historical approach, a little age is nothing to despair.  His quizzes are hard, frustratingly so, even if you've done the readings and attended every lecture.  Nearly everyone does poorly so the curve is quite generous.

While he by no means attempts to say he knows how this is to be done, the class is all about researching and exploring different measurements and techniques to try and get closer to determining the \"correct\" way of teaching from birth on, touching on issues such as socio-economic, gender, race differences, IQ and \"intelligence.\"  If you are at all interested in going into the education field as a teacher or policy maker I would highly recommend this class as one of the best I have taken in the Psychology department at Columbia.",

Granted, you wont learn a damned thing. Galantar seemed to be teaching us psychological breakthoughs of the 1940's rather anything current or interesting. Although, he's your typical old fart with great old fart humor. \nNormally, Id hate to bust everyone else's balls, but I feel I owe the Columbia community a service by recommending this class - trust me, it is not nearly as hard as these reviews make it out, and I know for certain that other students agree with me. And all the reviews from previous semesters agree with me.

The only explanation for why there are some positive reviews of this class is because Galanter USED TO curve each individual quiz grade, and then curve at the end.

I went to every single class, took copious notes, and did a fair amount of reading. However, NONE of that helps you out on what I've decided are prank quizzes.  Guessing does not help you on the quizzes either, so there's no way out. I do not know ANYONE who received a good grade in this course.  I ended up Pass/Failing as a senior (who needed to knock off the sciecne requirement) b/c of the grades I got on the first two quizzes. Galanter actually had bravado to offer to sign off on LATE DROPS because he realized how may people were going to fail the class!!! What a nice guy right!

Rest assured that you will learn something about psychology - mostly from the paragraph or two you read from the textbook in the middle of an open book test - but lectures consist of dead time between amusing and just plain bizarre comments.  Galater is senior faculty in his department, and he knows it.  He no more wants to be teaching an intro course than anyone in the class wants to be there.  Though it's more than obvious that he knows his stuff, he has a bit of trouble transmitting his knowledge, whether it's because he can't hear a question shouted out from the second row, can't remember how to derive a formula (\"Look in my book,\" he advised us, \"it's all there, written when I was a lot younger, a lot more coherent, and, if I'm remembering correctly, sober.\") . . . lectures aren't too necessary, but miss one and you risk missing one of his gems.

He also says global warming is ok, since Columbia is on a hill and should survive a rise in ocean levels.  That said, his lectures were cures for insomnia.  I have never seen more people openly sleeping and drooling before.  But his personal anecdotes are really funny and disturbing.  Evidently, the army considered using pidgeons to guide the controls for missiles in the 50s.  But if the class is too boring for you, its ok.  Galanter encourages people to not attend.  He also makes his quizzes open book, which helps alot (except for the poor delinquents who missed the class where the open book thing was announced).  The grading is cake, with probably the most generous curve i have ever seen.  It didnt seem like a curve,  more like him bumping up everyones grade by a letter.

He spent the first 3/4 of the semester talking about \"Psychophysics\" and thresholds, and while he likes to crack jokes every so often, he can get extremely boring. There were 200 people registered for the class - 100 people on any given day, and half of those people were sleeping in their chairs... another 25 either writing down his quotable quotes (such as: \"Trees are just big weeds\") or drawing pictures of him. Galanter's knowledgeable in psychology - especially in educational psychology & educational testing, but he presents his information in such a boring fashion that you can't appreciate his knowledge. Guest lecturers were a nice break from the banal lectures. Galanters test are \"mark incorrect\", which means that you can get partial credit if you can only identify 2 of the 3 incorrect answers. However, if you mark the correct answers as incorrect, you can wind up with a negative score. The curves on the quizzes are huge, and the final course grades are curved even more, so that the lowest grade given was a C, and there were A+s... Though I do not recommend this course, as I feel as if I learned no psychology from it, if you do take the class, I suggest that you attend his lectures, even if you sleep through them... many questions on the quizzes come right out of the babble that he says... Also, don't expect him to be very approachable - as far as I know he doesn't even have office hours. The TAs, however, proved to be somewhat helpful at least as far as telling us what was on the quizzes (don't study according to the syllabus).

Galanter sits back, lets the students do most of the teaching, and makes frequent comments from the peanut-gallery. But if you require an organized syllabus, forget about this one. Galanter lets the course wander where he and the students want it to go. My only objection was to some of the other members of the class. A few morons can really ruin a small class, though Galanter occasionally enjoys putting an ass-clown in his place. Rolling eyes, scrunched noses, and sarcastic retorts were commonplace.

Some people in the class considered Professor a \"dinosaur\" or \"relic of the past\"; I'd heard more than one or two frustrated mumbles during the course of any lecture, leading me to think that psychology students had begun to feel hostility towards a man who tried his damnedest to have the course live up to its name.

Also, it doesnt help that the material is not in the least bit interesting. The texts are too long, and seem to be books that he authored or co-authored, or that were authored by authors with whom he co-authored other books. No doubt, Professor Galanter is incredibly talented in this field. I am often impressed that he is able to lecture in great detail mostly without referring to notes. But the class seems not to be about psychology, but about topics that he is interested in, which are mostly dry, incredibly boring statistical analyses of basic psychological processes. I can't remember the last time that I went through a whole class period without falling asleep once. Usually the only thing that keeps me awake is my metaphysical ponderings on why exactly I am sitting in that gigantic surreal lecture hall--the information that Im hearing isn't useful for anything, and by God it certainly isn't interesting.

The TA was not very helpful in resolving either technical or interpersonal problems. You might get a mentor in one of the professor's PhD students, but remember that you might not get a lot of help unless you put it yourself. Everyone I went to talked in arcane terms that they expected you to know, but you wouldn't know anything about them unless you have prior background in that field. \r\n\r\nAnd compared to the fact that it has a 40% weightage, the professor does expect a little more than that. If you do take this course, brace yourself for some boring moments in the semester, and do not take up a project that would require you to write a lot of code from scratch. No one seemed to care that writing original, running source code for a nascent idea wasn't trivial (that was what my project was about, and unfortunately I had a partner who thought his job was only to supervise).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but to each his own.\r\n",

As a graduating senior heading out into the computer science workforce, I found the presentation of a broad range of topics very helpful. Though Prof. Shulzrinne didn't have time to go into great depth about any one topic (except maybe C programming), I felt that the overviews given (along with references to website where we could get more info) gave me a much better understanding of the tools & languages that are out there and what can be done with them. Other people in the class hated how we had to go searching for documentation around the web to find how to do certain things, but I thought it was actually very good preparation for the \"real world\" of software development jobs, where research of this kind is an essential part of the job. The class was taught exclusively with PowerPoint slides, which at times were the same as reading \"man\" pages, but Prof. Schulzrinne did provide a lot more related information in class (i.e. go to class). I don't know if the class really should be a replacement for softe, because (having taken that prior to this course), I found they were both useful, and that students will probably get more out of AP if it is taken after softe. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I need to commend Prof. Schulzrinne on his accessiblity (via e-mail). He answered all of the [many] questions that came to the e-mail mailing list, and always seemed to reply to e-mails very quickly. How many other professors do you know who would write back to you within an hour when you send an e-mail to him at 12:05 AM on a Saturday morning??",

This is the first time it was given, so expect some changes, but it covers a bunch of real tools in the marketplace, such as BASH, C, XML, SOAP, RPM, TKL, among many others. Its also apparently looked at as a precursor to Operating Systems for students who like to focus on coding instead of the theories behind it. What happens as the semester goes on, however, is that the usefullness of the subjects as they're taught varies inversely with their actual importance in the \"real world\". The class ends up wandering aimlessly as Schulzrinne simply presents bits and pieces of each subject through his powerpoint presentations. Then when homeworks come around, they're often on subjects hardly covered in class, and you're expected to google your way to tutorials provided elsewhere. This is especially the case with XML/Java (an very active & useful topic), where a few scant lecture slides leave you with nothing useful for the homework, and you end up learning it as though you're not even in a class that's supposed to teach it! Oreilly books to the rescue! When Schulzrinne ventures into talking about the marketplace of OpenSource vs PeopleSoft vs Proprietary and the like its like reading a weeks worth of slashdot. It occured to me that the people that are the most interesting to listen to on those subjects are out in the industry actually shaping their fates, not in the classroom. The bottom line is that, common to other Schulzrinne reviews on CULPA, he expects you to learn it based largely on unspecified non-class materials. And common to most all CS classes I've taken, the HWs serve as a good lesson in doing the HW, not necessarily in learning the subject (to be fair, the C assignments were a bit better as we spent about 5 weeks with it). I finish each one thinking about how next time I have to use whatever tool I'm going to have to learn the syntax mostly from the beginning anyway. The syllabus will probably improve after it gets reviewed a couple times, but the core experience is not much more educational than getting a linux machine and playing with these technologies on your own time. The only difference is that here you'll get a grade and 3 credits for it. I don't know if its better than softe, but from conversations I've had with friends it sure sounds like there's significantly less work and stress.",

His homework assignments tended to look difficult at the start (with the exception of a couple, notably the first and last ones), but then he'd describe in detail in class how to attack those problems. Of course, actually doing the programming would take at least one all-nighter per assignment; but if you really thought the problems through, you could definitely benefit from those assignments in terms of how much you learned about the particular data structure.\n\nHis teaching style tended to focus mainly on the homeworks, but that did not seem to limit the material he covered. He gave a lot of code in class, though almost always it was pseudocode. I never held this against him - trying to stick to exact syntax in a limited period of time is never worth it, and he more than made up for it with his descriptions of the code he put up.\n\nZeph was clearly coming from a math background, and that really seemed to influence his teaching. He wanted to make his students think (as evidenced by his way of \"reviewing\" - simply giving us very solvable, though certainly challenging, practice problems), though he always wanted his students to do well.

None of this stuff is even that hard, but it is presented in such a painfully poor way that you will develop an ulcer or two trying to digest it for yourself. First of all, the book (Sedgewick) is horrendous. I believe it is just a rewritten version of the Java edition, and it shows. The code snippets are written to be compact and brief, but they end up just being impossible to understand. Single-letter variable names, often referencing code from chapters before, are used without any explanation. The mathematical explanations are so hard to understand you will probably end up just skipping them. \n\nAs mentioned before, Zeph is a nice guy and clearly very intelligent but ultimately he fails to present the material well. First, you will never almost never speak about the contents of the book. Most of the class is presenting a sort of scaled-down, not-quite-there version of the code you will need for the homework. The problem is, Zeph seems extremely unprepared and often forgets vital lines of code. Even when he is satisfied it will work properly on the board, it probably won't compile when you go to do the homework. The other part of class is discussing mathematical issues behind algorithms. I'm not even going to touch on this--it's so difficult to understand, and taught with such little clarity, that you should save your brain cells and sanity and just zone out. \n\nNow we come to the homeworks. Ohh, the homeworks. \nThese monstrosities are surely meant to be sadistic. They only roughly help you learn about data structures, but the projects are so huge and the specifications so poorly, um, specified, that you will spend hours pulling your hair out trying to get the program to do something even closely related to what Zeph had in mind. \n\nNot to worry, of course, as with most CS classes the curve is outrageously huge. It doesn't seem as if Zeph cares much about whether we \"get it.\" For the final he gave us plenty of example problems, but no solutions. Days before the exam, he e-mailed us to tell us that no practice exam (as promised) would be coming. Well, the exam questions are much easier than the practice problems anyway. \n\nYou'll get through it -- probably. Just take my advice and keep some Tums and Prozac nearby. ",

He's an animated and entertaining lecturer who covers a lot of concepts with in-depth and interesting examples and applications (e.g. counting poker hands during the probability lectures). Everything you learn comes from the lectures-- the text was more of a backup and for homework exercies, and since they go by pretty quick, I'd say you have to be damn brilliant to not have to show up. I'm no math genius, so I found the material pretty difficult-- he'd often cover proofs in class that wouldn't sink in until I went though my notes and thought everything through much more slowly (and even then some  never fully did). Even so, it certainly wasn't impossible to grasp the concepts and be able to do well on the homework assignments and quizzes. Exams were really challenging (all in-class, 4-5 questions), consisting of completely original problems that required you to apply in new ways the skills acquired from lecture. Your success on exams, in my opinon, will largely depend on your mathematical creativity-- how flexible you can be in applying the concepts you know to a problem that's pretty different from what you've seen before. In my case, the particular way of working out some exam problems just would never have occurred to me (how to begin a proof, where to go next after you've reached a point, etc.), especially under the stress of an exam, so I did pretty bad on them. But they're curved pretty generously, and if you do well on homeworks, you can still do well in the course (and hard exams are nice-- they really get you to think). More important, though, the class is always interesting, and I think (especially if you haven't taken a course like it) you'll find yourself much better able to look into a problem then before.",

You can look at his papers on his website. His in class style is bell to bell an intense, but he is light hearted and loves to be in front of the class room. Zeph is also very well prepared, and has an interesting way of taking attendance. He randomly calls on just about everyone in the class about 3 times from an attendance sheet to learn your names. If your not there when he calls on you, tough luck, you loose points in participation. He will learn your names. He also has an online email newsletter thing that if you participate in instead of going to class he will accept that as participation. Material is tuff, and he is more the willing to help anybody, because sometimes the class isn't enough.

I don't know why professors are expected to be entertainers these days, but if that's what you care about in getting an education, I think Zeph always succeeds when he tries to be funny. He is as funny as his jokes so either you laugh with him or at him. Teaching-wise he's quite good; he's clear and he makes good lecture notes. The notes contain most materials but not some worked examples, and the materials are easier to understand when lectured to you than when you read them, so I definitely recommend going to class. Exams are generally tough, requiring thorough understanding and rewarding little for rote memorization. So do try to learn the concepts and don't use memorize the techniques. But if you have a solid math background (probably if you plan to do the CS theory track), the course should be easy for you. Others don't need to worry too much because the curve is quite generous. A note of caution: as with Computability as another poster mentioned, the first half of the course in general is much easier than the second half, possibly because the first half covers concepts you have more likely to have picked up in math classes. Also, things like probability seem to be very difficult for some people and very natural and easy for others. Flip through the book in the beginning of the course to get a general idea of the topics, then gauge your math aptitude/experience to budget your time.",

                "content": "This is an acceptable course, but I have mixed feelings about it. Let's establish some baseline. Dr. Gravano is undoubtedly a capable lecturer, able to explain concepts lucidly. He occasionally told jokes that made the classroom laugh (sometimes). I'm pretty certain he genuinely cares for his students. You will almost certainly learn a lot of new and useful stuff while taking this course. Overall, the course was planned and executed well.\r\n\r\nIf you are on the NLP or ML track \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or you have a strong interest in search engines or big data, you should certainly take this course. This course definitely falls squarely in that domain (I mean hey, the free textbook was on the NLP part of Stanford's website...). I suspect the facts you will learn will be very relevant to you. However, if you are on the software track taking this course just because it has good reviews and fulfills a requirement, I'd suggest giving other courses stronger consideration. I don't exactly regret taking this class, but I think I could have chosen better.\r\n\r\nDr. Gravano curves the median to a B+ or A-. You may be thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sure, I'll just score above average!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but in a 90 something class full of smart people and easy assignments and tests, this is tricky to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is a good component of luck involved.\r\n\r\nThe two tests which comprise 50% of your grade are themselves comprised of about 40% (each) true false questions. That's 20% of your grade roughly!  I felt that some of them were vaguely worded and it's pretty hit or miss if you remember the specific fact the question tests you on.\r\n\r\nYou'll either need a very good memory or be very planned and careful how you review the lectures, because you really could get tested on any bullet point in them. It's fair and doable, but that's not my style. I'd rather be tested on my ability to apply what I learned to solve problems than my ability to simply remember details about stuff I could recall by referring to the textbook or my notes (neither of which are allowed on the exams).  Oh, and the readings are often straight torture. Thankfully, I don't ever remember seeing a question that was in the reading but not the lecture. Much of the writing was by authors showing off their ability to encrypt simple concepts into Latex strings. Dr. Gravano's lectures blew the textbook out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the tests involve manually carrying out an algorithm he discussed in the lecture. The tests are easy, but I'm really not a fan of easy tests because mistakes will cost you a lot more. But that's obviously my opinion... you might think otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe HWs (java or python) certainly aren't trivial, but they aren't complicated either. The class generally averaged 9/10 on them with a very small standard deviation. I think I learned more about Python than I did about search algorithms or the subject matter of the class while doing the assignments. The first and last project implemented an algorithm that is probably only a step or two above the complexity of what you would encounter in an undergraduate data structures class at a reasonably competitive school. The second project mostly involved string formatting and learning how to use the API to google's open knowledge database. Personally, I found it pretty tedious. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say the assignments can be finished in two days. The API in the second project took forever to figure out, but I'd really rather invest my energy somewhere other than learning an API I won't use again in the foreseeable future. \r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is not a bad class. Good for some people, less so for others. As you can tell by the other positive reviews, some folks do enjoy it. I see where they are coming from. Some of the things I don't like about the class are a matter of personal taste. I hazard to say you will likely get your tuition's worth on this class. If you are NLP or ML I think you almost certainly will. I'm just saying this class isn't for everyone.",

The second half deals with DB I/O cost analysis, and was difficult enough for Prof. Gravano to turn into - take your pick - Derridean post-modern literary theory or Martian rocket science. Even in the project assignments the most obvious concepts were mangled into research paper theory filler - my project team mate, who sailed through the course, kept wondering why on earth the guy would go to such lenghts to turn the clear and easy into the hermetic and impossible. \n\nAgain, I never had any doubt that Prof. Gravano was putting more than enough effort on the class, considering that as a top scientist on the field he had a busy enough schedule, but the obscurity of his explanations made lectures a tough going, until by the second half he was making jokes about everyone falling asleep. The blank looks he was getting by then contrasted with the sincere interest everyone had on the course material before the midterm, when his challenges and questions started such debates, he had to stop and ask people to quiet down. \n\nThis is one of the few courses in which the difficult textbook proves more useful than the overflowing PP slides or the teacher's talk. The TA I was assigned for the project appeared to get kicks out of taking points for the most trivial mistakes, but then again, it is difficult to blame the teacher for such things - in fact he was the one who had to ask her to take it easy with the grading.

There's also homeworks, mostly easy, with an occasional twist. If you go to class, do the projects/homework and score above avg in the exams, you're guaranteed a B+. One caution sign I'd post is: don't ignore the prereqs. You *need* to know how to code, and you *need* to know some data structure stuff. Don't screw around on this one, or you'll run into trouble in the projects. Gravano is basically a good guy. He does his best to help you out (even tho he appears touchy in class when cellphones ring, laptops ping etc, and you got to get used to the self-deprecating humor bit.)

It was definitely tough.....did I walk out of some classes genuinely so confused...yes......did I walk out of some classes feeling like a CS god....yes.......that to me was the temperament of this class. I think Professor Cannon is a great teacher, but to me, more importantly, a great human. He teaches a big class, but if you go see him in OH he is genuinely interested in who you are, your story, etc. which to me is refreshing at Columbia. He is open to answering any questions and creates a very stimulating class environment. My advice for this class is to actually attend class and be present. It can be a tad on the boring side sometimes, but to me the material really started to sink in when I was making sure I understood his every step. Not just sitting in class to sit there. This class is amazing for non-majors looking to dip their toes in the CS pool to see if they like it. To me, the hardest part was the first few weeks.....no one teaches you how to think like a coder which to me is 75% of the struggle. Once you learn to think like one and can figure out how to think to code the solution to a probelm....you're golden. Its NOT AN EASY CLASS (at least for me), but I found it to be incredibly rewarding and I'm glad I took it. Cannon is a gem and so is this class, and I bet the same applies to any classes he teaches.

All of Professor Cannon's lectures were extremely engaging, and he clearly explains concepts (My fellow classmates, remember when he repeatedly emphasizes that instance variables are initialized in the constructor of a class). Despite having prior Computer Science experience, I learned so much about Java in this course. Professor Cannon really tries to help his students learn and complete the assignments. For example, for Assignment #8, which was the Crazy Eights game and the hardest assignment in the course, Professor Cannon made a review video and session to help us with the assignment. He also gave every student in my section a 48-hour extension on that assignment. Professor Cannon is also always open to feedback from students. During the class before the second Midterm, he initially planned to help us with the Deck class of the Crazy Eights game, but after listening to students about their worries regarding the Midterm, he decided to answer students' questions instead. I, as well as my classmates, will admit that Professor Cannon gives challenging assignments. However, Professor Cannon and the TAs, especially Griffin Newbold (he TAs for Cannon in Computing in Content and for his Intro Java course), enjoy helping students and answering their questions both on Ed Discussion and during office hours. I worked very hard on the assignments regardless of their difficulty, and as a result, I learned a lot about Java from Professor Cannon's challenging assignments. The challenge of his course allows students to learn a lot and be amazing programmers. Despite challenging his students, Professor Cannon is never demanding, unkind, or condescending. He cares much more about his students learning and becoming excellent programmers than about their grades. The Final Exam had a 67.8% average, but since the class average grade at the end of the semester was less than the high B cutoff, Professor Cannon curved his students' grades to a high B. Don't worry! Professor Cannon does not want his students to fail, and he never curves down; instead, as I said, he is concerned about his students learning, not about their grades. After each of our Midterms, he even told his students in lecture that if they do not get good grades in tests, they are not bad people :)",

Both Midterms consisted of 30 multiple choice questions. If you are good at Computer Science, work hard in the class, and are not a bad test taker, you will probably pass the Midterms or even do great on them. The averages for Midterms were late 70% to early 80%. The Final Exam had multiple choice questions, short answer questions (they only require you to write a word or a line of code), and coding questions. Professor Cannon made the Final Exam more challenging than the Midterms (I am assuming from my personal experience that most of the challenge was in the coding portion). The class average for the Final Exam was 67.8%, but Professor Cannon curved to a high B. Make sure you study hard for the Final Exam and try your best on it to really benefit from the curve.\n\nProfessor Cannon's grading is only somewhat fair. I think the TAs applied the style guide quite harshly when grading the programming assignments, to the point that the grading seemed untransparent to me. There were guidelines students can easily apply from the style guide with minimal or no mistakes; however, the TAs sometimes gave students a grade deduction for something that pertains to style but was not fully explained by them and Professor Cannon. For example, I once received a style guide violation for writing excessive comments, but Professor Cannon and the TAs did not fully explain to me in advance how to write good comments. They did tell us numerous times to write comments in our code.\n\nOn average, I spent four to thirty hours per week on assignments for this course. The amount of time I spent on the assignments varied based on their difficulty. I found Homeworks 8 and 9 to be incredibly challenging, so I spent immense time on them (around thirty hours). On the other hand, a few assignments were simple and easier, so I did not have to spend as much time on them. I spent a few hours studying for each Midterm Exam, but I almost always joined the weekly review sessions. To clarify, I mean, apart from the weekly review sessions, I spent a few hours watching other recorded review sessions, asking questions on Ed Discussion and in TAs' office hours, and reviewing my notes and code from class. My scores on Midterms 1 and 2 were 26/30 and 27/30, respectively. On the first Midterm, which was online and all multiple-choice, I accidentally clicked the wrong answer choice, so I would say I really earned 27/30. I studied around fourteen hours for the Final Exam, and this also includes the Final Exam review session a few TAs hosted. My grade on the Final Exam was 81%, which is greater than the class average and two points less than the upper quartile, but the Final Exam was harder than the Midterms.\n\nMy final grade in the class was 90.6% or an A!"

The only thing I took away from this class is that java uses a lot of semi-colons and brackets? I guess I learned a little bit about the internet and Von Neumann architecture? \r\n\r\nThe midterm was straightforward I guess, as was the final (but I took this class during the corona semester so idk what the real final would have looked like).\r\n\r\nTLDR; if you're not a CS major and just want a fun intro class, take 1006 or 1002.

ADHERE TO THE STYLE GUIDE RELIGIOUSLY! The TAs can be real sticklers about the formatting of your code and the actual files you submit.

It\u2019s a cakewalk if you get your hands on past exams. The mean was about a 78 in my semester.\r\n\r\nFinal (35%) - It mirrors the midterm for the most part, but it also includes a section where you debug code by hand.

He is entertaining during his lectures, and although he can seem a little unapproachable, he is much less intimidating if you go talk to him during office hours. He also responds to emails quickly if there is a logistics issue. I took AP CS, so the content of the class wasn't that difficult, though there are things to learn even if you did take AP CS, like Turing machines, Dijkstra's algorithm, exception handling, von Neumann architecture, and information about the layers of computer networks. (If you know all of that and took AP CS you could potentially skip to Data Structures, though it was nice to be able to review everything I already knew to really get a firm grip on the material.) I could see the class being a little difficult for people going in with no experience as he doesn't really explain the syntax in depth and you probably will need to do a fair about of self teaching, but conceptually he does a great job explaining everything. I found the midterm and final pretty easy. They were mostly definitions and multiple choice and the final had coding and short answer. Just make sure you pay attention during lecture to all the details. He actually does tell you the answers to some of the harder questions during class. I also really appreciated his organization. Problem sets and projects come out on a timely basis each week. He often codes live for you as well and sends you the code that is done is class, which is helpful. ",

There are tons of office hours, which you should go to right away if you are confused, especially at the beginning of the semester because computer science builds on itself. My advice is to start the projects early (seriously, look at the prompt before class and then try to do half of it by the next class and then finish before the deadline) and get help often. You might want to look at some online coding courses before hand, but it isn\u2019t necessary. Many people take this class having never looked at code before in their life and are fine, but it is definitely harder because coding is a new way of thinking that might not work for you.

                "content": "I imagine this class would be very difficult to succeed in with no programming background.  I took AP Computer Science in high school, so I expected Cannon's class to be cake.  However, it still did require a good deal of effort and I felt appropriately challenged throughout the semester.  As past reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve is pretty steep, with problem set 1, and programming projects 2-4 being among the most stressful.  Cannon is not kidding when he says that the programming projects will require 10+ hours of work -- they really do!  Your best bet would be to start early on the projects and attend TA office hours whenever you hit a major rut.  \r\n\r\nLectures are helpful, but only as a brief summary of what you need to know.  To rely on lectures alone would leave you poorly prepared for the assignments in this class, but I think that for any technical class this goes without saying.  The two recommended textbooks are both very good resources and will be relied on heavily throughout the course.  I found that the lectures and problem sets were representative of exam content.  The programming projects, however, were not.  \r\n\r\nThe class is well organized, with a very clear outline of covered topics and assigned grading groups to expedite grading.  There is an entire army of TAs who rotate on a schedule to grade your problem sets/programming projects and who send you detailed grade reports VIA lionmail (more on the TAs later...).\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the course does a good job at its ambitious task of introducing students to the fundamentals of computer science and programming in Java.  In addition, you will also be introduced to software like: Pico, CUnix, CyberDuck, Eclipse, Vagrant VirtualBox (maybe), and Gimp.  Professor Cannon has a good sense of humor and tries to make even the duller aspects of computer science interesting.  If you commit yourself to doing all the work, the takeaway is enormous.  My only major complaint:\r\n\r\nTHE TAs (well, some of them):\r\n\r\nThe TAs are a mixed lot.  Some are truly wonderful and are willing to help you with all your NullPointerExceptions, while others seem plain butthurt about losing points for inane reasons back when they were COMS W1004 students.  Between the 6 problem sets and 5 programming projects, you'll come into contact with at least 11 of the TAs.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, your grade reports are sent to your lionmail by your TA of the week.  Frequently, students will respond to the grade report emails to ask for suggestions or for a more detailed explanation of how to improve code.  As I have heard from other students, and as I have experienced myself, this sometimes results in the TAs correcting your grade to a lower score.  What I mean is this: when the TA sees your grade report again in your reply email, they might see that they made a mistake in grading you and then will lower your score by the appropriate amount.  \r\n\r\nUntil the TAs start grading things without error, or until some sort of \"grade-is-set-after-sending-to-student\" policy is put into place, you should not ask the TA who graded you for pointers.  I repeat DO NOT ASK THE TA WHO GRADED YOUR ASSIGNMENT ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT--THEY MIGHT SPOT SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T TAKE OFF POINTS FOR AND THEN PROCEED TO TAKE OFF POINTS FOR IT.\r\n\r\nTo me this seems rather messed up.  Isn't the best person to learn from the professional who was paid to read through every line of your code?  As things currently are, it is impractical to talk to this person because they could easily spot a mistake in their grading and then make a last-minute change on CourseWorks.  In no other class I've ever taken in my academic career have assignment grades been so impermanent.  I overheard other students in the help room speak of \"avoiding\" the TA that graded their most recent assignment in fear that they could have points deducted.  I hate to think I could have done better in this class by NOT asking the person who graded my assignment for help...",

If you don't ask questions or follow up his lectures with your reading, you will get left behind. Be sure that you keep up at all times! (also, the textbooks for this class are quite helpful).\r\n\r\nFor problem sets and programming projects, do not procrastinate! They take much more time than you think they do (he's not kidding when he says that the class will require at least nine hours of work per week). If you get stuck, go to office hours, ask a CS friend, or use Piazza (the online messaging board) to get your questions answered. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'm glad that I took this course.

He knows his stuff, and while excuses have to be made since this is only the 3rd year this course exists, he is still refining the curiculum. However, while the cotent of the lectures was interesting (read: sometimes, other times not falling asleep was hard) they were only vaguely related to the homework, and most of the time, were it not for online documentation on Python, me and all my friends in the class would have failed. Although he leaves time in lecture for questions, his sometimes sarcastic answers and interactions with students discourage many from asking. Oftentimes, he will not actually answer the question posed in class, just tells you to \"deal with it\" in a roundabout way, or gives a non-sensical answer. His office hours dont help: although he holds the same amount of office hours as other professors, he is teaching about 400 students at a time, so there is always at least a 10-20 student line waiting to talk to him during office hours. To be fair though, there are about 5 TAs, though they often are not clear on the specific requirements of the assignment and will sometimes give you wrong information if you ask a mildly specific/complex question on the problem sets. Desperate emails sent the day before the homework is due dont get answered until after the dealine (though to be fair, he warned us that he would take minumum 1 or 2 days to respond due to the impressive amount of emails he gets). \r\n\r\nOverall, although Cannon is a good teacher, he is not good for this course. The learning curve is very slow for the first 3 weeks, and gets incredibly hard after that. While about half the students in the class have programmed before, for the half who have not, the problema set take significantly more hours tan the 8-12 Cannon gives as reference. So start early. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE OR YOU WILL NOT FINISH. \r\n\r\nAvoid this class unless you actually have to take it or you are pursuing a mayor/minor/concentration/ect in computer science or related fields. Takes up more time tan what is justified for a class that does not related or is not required for your degree (it is ridiculous how much time it takes away from studying for those clases which actually count towards your degree)!).",

If you fall into the latter group, like myself, I HIGHLY recommend reading up a bit on Python before you take the class because the learning curve is steep.  This review will come from the perspective of someone with no former programming experience:\r\n\r\nIntro to Comp Sci for Eng/App Sci is still in its 3rd year of infancy, so Adam Cannon is still developing the curriculum for this class.  Adam Cannon is a really nice guy who often makes the types of sardonic jokes that provoke a chuckle or two, verbally assumes that his class hates him, and gives riddles at the beginning of class to those students who already know the material and can afford to spend the duration of class pondering the riddle, life itself, or if they should attend the next class.  Lectures consisted of him going through topics rather rapidly (for someone who knows nothing of Python) and explaining examples of programs posted in CourseWorks.  For people with programming experience, the feeling of rushing may not have been the case, but some topics he introduced--especially for the homework--could be quite challenging.  We did not have a textbook, which I think would have been helpful, but I believe he is getting one next semester.  Often in class, Professor Cannon would ask if there were any questions and be greeted by silence and blank stares, to which he would respond, \"If 1 of you doesn't understand something, that means 10 more of you don't understand it either,\" sigh, and move on, so ASK QUESTIONS if you don't understand something.  Those afraid to ask questions will be extremely grateful that you did.\r\n\r\nHomework consists of bi-weekly projects that can be very tricky, so try not to procrastinate on these because Professor Cannon will answer questions about/go over the homework in class sometimes.  That being said, he will not baby you and give you the answer, only try to lead you on a path to finding the right answer, both in class and in office hours.  The TAs are all awesome and extremely nice (even if they are all really busy), and I highly recommend going to their office hours.  Both the midterm and final are written and doable, but you should study for them, no matter what programming background you have.  Overall, although this can be a challenging class, Adam Cannon is a satisfactory teacher, but it is up to you--the student--to ask him for help if you need it.",

With this in mind, Intro to Java is probably one of the most challenging and time-consuming classes offered at Columbia. Unless you have to take this class for your major, be sure you REALLY want to take this class. There are much easier ways to learn coding and Java. When Cannon tells you at the beginning that this class will take at least 10 hours of work per week, he is telling the truth. Many times, the work requires a lot more than 10 hours/week. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of information that Cannon tries to teach in this course. You will learn both theory and programming in this class. Because of the amount of info he tries to teach, Cannon skips over a lot of basic stuff that he expects you to learn on your own. I had no experience in programming coming in so I wish he would not have skipped over stuff. For this reason, I would only recommend this class to someone who has some experience or background in coding. Talking to many who were in the same boat as me, we had to play catch-up throughout the semester. This class is already considered difficult to those with coding backgrounds, so it makes life even more miserable when you have to put even more work into an already difficult class.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for the class are usually pretty helpful. I would recommend getting help from the TA that grades your assignments since some of the grading, especially the written assignments, can be very subjective. I also went to Cannon's office hours. He does not come off as the nicest or most personable person ever, but he does try to help you out. He definitely does not try or care to get to know students (at least in this class). I will give him props for his cheesy jokes that lighten up the class.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you really have to decide if you are willing to do the work for the class. If you just want to take this class because you think coding will be \"fun\" to learn, do not take the class. Learn coding on your own at a pace where it can be fun, exciting, and addictive. Besides those who are majoring in CS, only those who are serious about learning Java and the theory of programming in a rigorous and often cutthroat setting should take this class.",

I usually feel bad when people don't laugh at his dumb jokes so I laugh pretty hard to give him some credit. I usually enjoyed going to lecture. I never brought my computer, though, because all his example code is posted on courseworks anyway. You can do your note-taking just as well in a traditional notebook, and if you know that you are easily distracted, I'd recommend not bringing a computer. The two lectures that I did bring one I may as well not even have showed up because I have no idea what happened.\r\n\r\nThe course itself is hard, for sure. This class is an introduction CS and programming class, so if you never took AP Computer Science in high school, you're going into a topic that you've literally never seen before, unlike most of your other classes. It's pretty satisfying, though, when a few weeks in you're already writing simple programs that can do tasks that you couldn't do a few weeks before.\r\n\r\nThe programming assignments are tough, especially compared to the homework which literally take maybe 1-2 hours tops. Programming takes probably 10ish hours. The singular most important advice is go to the TA office hours. There are like 8 TAs for the class. Obviously the TA hours the day before your assignment is due are going to be packed, so try to go earlier if you can. The ones in the middle of the week are literally empty so you could have one-on-one time to do your work with a TA sitting right there who sole purpose is to answer any questions you have and help with your programming.\r\n\r\nCannon also sets up an account for the class on this website, Piazza.com, that is basically a messaging board where people can ask questions and the TAs, other students and Cannon (occasionally) can answer questions.

This class gives you a great overview of Computer Science, and an unmatched introduction to programming. Somehow Cannon manages to fit in a ton of material while still giving a good sense of each topic. The only exception to this would be the section of the class on computer networks, which I honestly feel could have been narrowed down to just the information about internet protocols. \r\n\r\nLearning object-oriented programming has a learning curve, but once you've got it, you're just coasting from then on. That's not to say projects don't take a while -- you'll spend hours trying to find bugs in your program. But in general, I think there's only a few concepts in this class that are difficult to learn, the main one being OOP. Nonetheless, Cannon and the TAs make themselves pretty available to you, and the assignments are not unreasonable.

There was a lot of learning on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own simply because there was so much material, but there were resources there for use that could make one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life a whole lot easier, such as TAs.  This is where I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.  Madhavan was a standout TA.  He stayed after his office hours by as much as three hours one time because people needed help.  When he was in the TA room attending office hours for his own CompSci classes, he would help 1004 kids who needed help.  No matter how many people came he would individually go through his students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 code to find problems big and small.  He also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t treat students who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know things like idiots which is more than can be said for some others of the TAs.  I would know, I went to pretty much every TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office hours.  Madhavan was not an easy grader, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because he knows his stuff and demands a high standard; if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be held to a high standard, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Columbia.  The TA Matt was also awesome though he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my primary TA so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know his grading style\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  Cannon was helpful but impersonal, class of 300\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  You will feel accomplished after taking this class, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to sail.

While his lectures aren't always structured like they're coming from an outline you can copy down, they aren't boring and they do get the information across.  The point of Discrete Math is to make you learn to think through problems, and few problems in the real world just appear in your head with a clear path to get you from A-B-C-D-E.  If it were that easy, it wouldn't be a problem that you needed to learn how to solve.  When he lectures, he doesn't just go A-B-C-D-E, he tries to get you to think about the process behind getting to E.\r\n\r\nThe class covered a lot of material very fast, and it definitely helped if you had a rudimentary familiarity with things like statistics, logic, and counting.  But if you didn't he gave enough information that you should have been fine.\r\n\r\nHis lecturing style is a bit free flowing.  He seems to have an ordered list of a dozen or so things to get through each lecture, and will work through them.   He does enjoy occasional diversions to related topics.  He clearly likes the material and manages to keep what could be a very dry topic interesting.  He welcomes questions, and is one of the best professors I've seen at being able to explain concepts multiple ways when people don't grasp them.  If you ask a stupid question, he won't sugar-coat his response, but he won't out-right mock you either.  And in one-on-one interactions, he's great.  Very approachable.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, he was usually 5 minutes late to class, and there was a very long lag time for homework to be graded and returned.\r\n\r\nAnd he LOVES his definitions.

It is true, he wasn't on cruise control as he is while teaching 1004, but he was still very good. His explanations were intuitive and clear and he realized that most people taking the class had not had previous exposure to a higher level of mathematics. As a result, he time again emphasized and explained to us, the importance of thinking truly mathematically as it were. In other words, he taught us to recognize the importance and place of proofs in mathematics and stated that while examples are often helpful, they are simply not adequate to understand abstract concepts completely. He sometimes proved theorems which were not in the book, so be aware of that and occasionally makes notational mistakes on the board so don't be afraid to point them out as he often doesn't notice them afterwards. I felt lost in only one of the lectures which was the one on solving liner homogeneous and non-homogeneous recurrence relations, I don't know what happened there but it seemed like Adam Cannon was having a monologue with the board for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn class, he asks interesting puzzles related to the material and will always give you an idea about the real-world applications of the concepts being covered. He is also just friendly and approachable. He has 4 office hours a week, which is more than most professors, although there is often a line so go early. Definitely go to office hours if you get stuck on the homeworks, he's more than happy to help. He'll rarely give away an answer but will certainly tell you how to approach any given problem.",

They were pretty long in an absolute sense, but given that we had two weeks to solve them, the length was by no means unreasonable. A quarter to a third of the problems in each assignment were proofs but most of these followed almost straightaway from the definitions. Writing proofs was hard at first for some people, but then again learning how to write basic proofs is half the point of the class. The bulk of the time-consuming problems are in the earlier part of the assignment so you can get started early during the 2 week period. One thing I did find was that the point distributions on the homeworks could be bizarre and some hard problems had very few points assigned to them. Also the TAs sometimes graded kind of harshly so if you think they overlooked something and your solution was correct, definitely go back to them and ask.\r\n\r\nMidterm was easy, the 2 proofs were perhaps the only tricky part. The final was cumulative and the questions were difficult. Lots of counting problems, 4 proofs  (3 of them manageable) and some modular arithmetic. 20 points is testing vocabulary so these are basically free points and you have to learn the definitions anyway in order to do well on the proofs. It also doesn't take all that long. According to him, the class is curved to a high B so about 30-40% of people get some sort of an A."

Plus Cannon always goes on random CS-related tangents every once in a while and these are generally fun and informative.\r\n\r\nAs for the class, it's got two components; theory (Intro to CS) and programming (Intro to Java). Theory and programming homeworks alternate from week to week. Theory homeworks are not too bad, they can be done just from reading the relevant chapters in the book. Programming ones can be challenging and take varying amounts of time (depending on who you are) but you will certainly learn how to program at the end of it.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final aren't all that bad if you've been keeping up with the lectures and the homeworks. They're a bit on the memorization side of things - especially the final which asked some pretty obscure questions which is why it's good to attend lecture because he often mentions random things that I noticed ended up on the test.\r\n\r\nI should mention that although this is intro CS, it's a pretty high level intro so don't take the class for the granted - you'll have to put in some work to get an A.\r\n\r\nAlso there are lots of office hours and for the most part the TAs are great so I would highly recommend popping in if you have question regarding your assignment; even if you code works, you might wanna just make sure with the TAs that your design, etc. is okay.",

But the weekly assignments were pretty difficult and/or very time-consuming. You MUST start each assignment at least 4-5 days before the due date, because you will run into problems with your programs and you need time to meet with the TA's. I found that many students taking the class had prior programming experience and they found it easier (and messed up the curve). But for the rest of us it was a grueling learning experience.

I would recommend this course to any strong student up for a challenge, even one who does not need COMS as a requirement.  Professor Cannon says it is not easy and tells us which assignments are especially hard, but CS will teach you a new way of thinking about the world.  Professor Cannon covers the basics of both hardware (the physical structure of the computer) and programming, so by the time you're done with the course you will probably know which topic you like better.  Lectures supplemented the readings and helped clarify which aspects of the materials were the most important.  One of Professor Cannon's strengths was making complicated concepts understandable.  He is willing to go over the same idea more than once, even at the expense of glossing over a few simpler programming concepts that I would have liked the lectures and assignments to cover a bit more thoroughly.  The final was DEFINITELY harder than the midterm, although neither was excessively difficult.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea for people without a very strong programming/hardware background to take W1004--you learn quite a bit about both and are a much more fluid programmer by the time you reach the more advanced courses.  Professor Cannon was very good at introducing us to the academic organizations and resources the CS department offers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are many TAs means that you should be able to come to a good TA's office hours (in my experience, decent to good TAing was the rule rather than the exception).

Such hint is so useful when you are bombarded with tons of vocabs and info that you encounter in the textbook; because then you know which the primary and important stuff are and which are not. Also, he explicitly provided studying strategies for the midterm, which, of course, can be used in other classes.

I had no previous programming experience, but I decided to stay in CS1007 because I knew that I would learn more in that class. Prof. Cannon said that students without prior programming experience would find the class difficult (even those who had a lot of programming experience had a hard time), but the class is do-able and Prof. Cannon made sure to say that he would be as supportive as he can.  And he was.  He also made class fun -- he is funny and witty and actually makes you want to go to class (and you should go.  Many times he covered concepts that weren't in the textbook, and we needed to know those concepts for the exams and to complete our homework assignments).\n\nIf you're looking for an easy A in computer science, then CS1007 is not for you.  Take Professor Cannon's advice and take CS1004 (though I'm not sure what the workload is in that class.  I know it's easier than 1007, though).  But if you're looking for a class that will challenge you and make you proud of all that you've learned, then be brave and take CS1007 and make sure to take it with Prof. Cannon.  He is one of the best professors I've encountered so far at Columbia.  You will learn a whole lot of programming and will be surprised about the things you learn to do.",

While it does not fulfill any requirement, Prof Cannon does all he can to get you involved in the class and interested in computers and computer-science in general. His light attitude and wonderful sense of humor makes the class fun and very enjoyable. Prof. Cannon is also incredibly accessible, responding incredibly quickly to e-mails and doing all he can to ensure that every student of his enjoys the class. While some parts of various lectures are rather boring, Prof Cannon always tries to lighten the mood by telling a few, jokes, making fun of himself, or just going onto a more interesting topic when he notices students starting to drift off. The class covers everything from a history of computer science, to a very little bit of programming. A great class for someone who thinks s/he might want to do Comp-Sci but doesn't know what it really is. This class was one of the best I have taken here at Columbia. Prof. Cannon is definitely one to look for.",

I feel that he tries to relate to students almost too much, however, since he basically tells us we don't have to show up for lectures and that it's okay to fall asleep.

Bearing a bit of a resemblance to Dave Matthews, he does happen to be a really cool guy. He also exudes a real enthusiasm for the subject, which is a bit of a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of really knowing the material very well. He forgot the JAVA syntax frequently, and occasionaly was at a loss for an answer to a student's question. For people without any programming experience at all, expect to be really lost for the first month or so - Professor Cannon has a hard time getting fundamental concepts across in a coherent manner. Luckily, if you're willing to go to his office hours, and if you attend recitation, these things really do get cleared up, and by the end you really do have a strong grasp of JAVA.

If you're not planning on majoring in comp sci, I advise taking this introductory course as opposed to CS1007. At the beginning of the course I thought Prof. Leslie was the worst teacher on the face of the earth, but then I realized that Comp Sci is just the worst subject on the face of the earth and that she is actually a pretty good teacher. She clearly presents ideas that are very complicated to understand. Her lessons are very structured and she makes the material as simple to understand as it can possibly be. Don't be alarmed if your a bit confused for the first 2 or 3 weeks, because if you've had no comp sci background (much like I had none when taking this course) it takes a little while to get used to the concepts. Prof. Leslie is an excellent teacher, although she is a bit nervous up there (i.e.: she laughs a lot when she talks and she writes EVERYTHING she says on the board!!!!! (in other words, if she says, \"It's sunny today\" you better believe it'll be up on the blackboard\")). She is also very approachable and extremely understanding.

Professor Sklar is the nicest person in the world and will do everything in her power to help you if you actually go to her. She is pretty quiet, and won't come to you, even if she thinks you're doing badly. If seek her out though, I have never seen a professor go to such lengths to help her students. She even has an aim sn just to help students on the nights before big assignments are due. She is usually a little bit late everywhere but she's a fine lecturer and presents the material she has to present clearly (ps people complaining about her writing code on the board a lot, all of the code up there is usually on the website). \nThe class however, is a complete nightmare. None of the annoying weekly labs are that hard, and the homeworks are definitely resonable, but you switch languages every week. I suppose if you really know you're stuff (ie you've programmed in pretty much all of the languages others have mentioned some before) you can skip a bunch of the lectures and labs and do fine in the class. However, even if you're a major, if you're just taking the class right after 1007/1004 you're going to be in pain (even if you did well, I got an A in 1007). And looking up syntax/googling everything for all of the assignments all all the time. The department is pretty ridiculous to expect second semester majors with limited experience to do very well in the course. \nMoral of the story: unless you're programmer extraordinare go to office hours and make lots of friends you can run to at 3am for help",

I had lab in 9 in the morning, so I would cut it often, but going to them makes you get the labs done faster (for the same reason you get HW done faster at a library).

The point of reviewing this course is more to alert students who are going take it to some of the difficulties they may face (she's teaching it again Spring 2003). That said, Prof. Sklar is not a bad teacher--not at all, especially when compared to many other SEAS and Physics/Chem/Math professors. For the most part she means well and is quite flexible and open. I think the main problem with the course was the overly aggressive syllabus--which has more to do with the CS department and the unfortunate fact that it is pretty much still experimental than with Prof. Sklar herself. Officially, the course is to \"better prepare students for courses like OS and Networks\". However I felt it was trying to cover such and such topics just so that the department can suppose we know them when in reality we only know _about_ them. _In short, in this class the syllabus is more important than you_. As with most other CS classes, there are some very prepared people with extensive C and UNIX and internet programming backgrounds who find the course and the lectures a joke. The ultra-motivated student with a lot of time in their hands may enjoy the \"sink-or-swim-ness\" by swimming very hard and doing a lot of reading and experimenting on their own. The average student may also do well by doing the bare minimum and choosing cheesy ways out in programming assignments but will unlikely feel satisfied with the experience.",

And instead of teaching us C++ which would have actually built off of our knowledge of C, she tried to teach us CGI in one day, javascript in one day... you get the idea.

My feeling is that she felt she needed to distinguish between the good students and the very good ones, but she definitely overdid it. She doesn't seem very experienced in teaching and sometimes (just sometimes) forgets basic stuff (like converting a base 10 number to its binary equivalent). But overall she's fine and she tries to make classes interesting by showing random stuff such as video clips and cracking silly jokes. Personally she's the no-bullshit type, looks tough (every time when she comes into class and drops her apparently very heavy backpack onto the podium (bang!) i think, wow she's some lady). She is (I think) a less friendly than other _young female_ professors. In short, people who use excuses like \"my grandma died\" for late homework shouldn't be hopeful. Graduated from Barnard so knows Columbia well. Majored in CS and English, so is pretty literary and definitely not illiterate like some other CS professors. Overall not bad, above average.

And don't old people want to wait before being spoken to?  I don't know.  I don't know.  One time I told him that he was miscategorizing anarchism and he didn't end the conversation but didn't really respond to me either.  I take out my cellphone and pretend to look busy.

Instead of hearing my peers who have been in three philosophy classes, I got to just sit and listen to someone who has been studying philosophy for 60 years.\r\nGrades were based only on the midterm and final, which, contrary to his claims of them \"probably being easier than than they should be\", were actually disproportionately difficult, though not unreasonably so.",

In a way I applaud him for not overreaching the scope of a semester long college course (although that would be a bit of an understatement), because I do feel like most teachers try to cram in way too much reading and no one absorbs anything.  However, it was simple too slow.  We covered the major moral philosophies, but I feel like I could've learned about as much from 2-3 hours of reading on Wikipedia.  Sidorsky was nice and sometimes told some great stories, but I only heard them when I could stay away.  Students' heads were dropping like flies.  I'd be whipsering to my friend for a minute trying to pass the time and then I'd realize that he'd nodded off.  The class is pretty easy.  He doesn't like to give below a B, and he gives plenty of A's and A-'s.  But, you aren't going to learn that much, and it's really, really slow.

I suppose another reason to take him would be if you enjoy listening to anecdotes and stories and if you want to impress your friends and family by knowing random historical trivia.\n\nNot only does he not cover much material, he screws up the material he does cover (I've never accused another prof. of doing this, so don't think I'm some thinks-he-knows-it-all undergrad. This guy holds the unique position of being the ONLY professor I do not respect intellectually. He seems to have just lost whatever intellectual ability he had - and I don't doubt that he used to have plenty). \n\nOh, his stories may seem spontaneous but, having taken 20th Century Philosphy with him I can tell you that he tells the same damned stories in both classes (How can you trust the review of an idiot who didn't learn from his mistake and took two of this guy's classes? I admit that was really dumb. I needed an easy class on my schedule this semester and it doesn't get any easier than Sidorsky. Also, 20th Century was marginally better.

In Moral Philosophy we covered a grand total of 7 papers (in the form of interpreted excerpts from the textbook), which were each boiled down to about 4 or so very basic points.  Furthermore, the only meta-ethical paradigm covered was naturalism (how do you teach an moral philosophy class without even mentioning consequentialism?).  Sidorsky barely touched on problems with the Authors' systems -- if you like to read philosophy critically, it will be largely impossible for you to stay focused on the lectures for more than 20 minutes.  Moral Philosophy V3701, as far as the lectures are concerned, was largely a philosophy-qua-literature class in which memorization of the absolute basics of the authors\u00c2\u2019 ideas was the primary focus instead of using the ideas as a vehicle for coming to a deeper understanding of morality.  The upside is I guess that you\u00c2\u2019ll be able to say a few sentences about the historical context of these authors and their most basic points if their names ever come up at the dinner table.   Oddly, however, the excessively long exams ask you to evaluate the authors\u00c2\u2019 ideas over and over and over again until you can\u00c2\u2019t feel your fingers gripping your pen.  Overall, it\u00c2\u2019s a cinch to get a B, but pretty tough to get an A as its difficult to know what he\u00c2\u2019s looking for.  In conclusion: this class is not for philosophy majors.   I repeat: this class is not for philosophy majors.  Did I mention that it\u00c2\u2019s not for philosophy majors?  Annoyed?  Just wanted to point out that it\u00c2\u2019s not for people who can\u00c2\u2019t stand repetition (and not really learning much for your tuition).  ",

He is old, and sometimes he speaks slowly, but he has a profound understanding of the texts and is good at explaining them using his own examples. Furthermore, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature, and he weaves references to art, culture, and science into his lectures, thereby connecting the class material to other disciplines. Besides being informative, it is fun to watch his intellectual acrobatics: in one class he quoted the beginning of the Canterbury Tales in Middle Enlgish, a passage from Isaiah in biblical Hebrew, and listed a dozen Roman emperors in chronological order with their corresponding prime numbers (hmm, this sounds a bit crazy, but there was a point to it all). I gather from CULPA that Sidorsky has a reputation for repeating himself, but don't worry, this is not unselfconscious repetion. He goes over important points from the previous lecture at the beginning of most classes--something I found quite helpful. So take a class with Sidorsky while you still can.

An easy A if you have the willpower to attend most of the lectures (see, you don't even have to attend all).  I do like him quite a bit as a professor.  He knows his material and if you read his articles, you'll find that he's extremely intelligent and articulate.

It is not often that your professor has the ability to lecture and provide the insight that can only be provided given that they were present during the time frame of what they were teaching. His lectures got repetitive as he took a long time to get through material bc he was constantly reviewing and rehashing. His eyesight is less than stellar as he will ask for questions and miss the raised hand that is in the front row. He definately knows his material well and delivers it well. as the last reviewer stated, show up to class, some part of the grade is attendance and exams are entirely lecture note based.",

Nevertheless, it\u00c2\u2019s an easy grade if (1) you attend class on a daily basis (2) manage to pay attention to each nuance of his circumlocutive lectures (3) repeat everything he says in class and regurgitate it on the midterm and final. However, if you\u00c2\u2019re looking to understand post-Kantian moral philosophy, take a rain check.\n\nIf you manage to satisfy the first three criteria, keep in mind, he also has an annoying predilection for handing out class attendance sheets, writing extremely long midterms and finals, as well as pulling out nine students from taking the midterm because of lack of class attendance. His course is seriously lacking substance, depth, and coherence, but makes up for it by being a nice guy. After all, you have to give him credit for pushing seventy and still teaching.\n",

As a result, if you're not feeling his reference of the day, you're going to pass out from boredom as you hear him mention it for the twentieth time. Worse, if you don't understand what he's saying, it's hard to steer him away from his theme. Still, some of his tricks work really well, even if he doesn't go into much depth (which none of his lectures really do). My main difficulty with the class was staying attentive, as his old man's voice and repetition makes it pretty easy to space out. This ordinarily wouldn't be that much of a problem, but because the class is so lecture oriented, it's important to pick up on whatever he says. ",

However, he's a bit senile these days.\r\n\r\nThis course was pretty light for a 4000 level CS class. We literally did nothing the first third of the semester. Traub just rambled on about super computers and Moore's Law for 2 weeks. The rest of the semester was ok, covering complexity theory for numerical algorithms, multi-dimensional integration, solving PDEs and solving arbitrary systems of non-linear equations. I learned a bit, but could definitely have learned way more if Traub made the class harder.\r\n\r\nHe assigns 12 HWs - each is either one programming assignment (definitely under 200 lines in any language) or a single problem/proof. He often makes multiple HWs due at the same time which is annoying. Most of the assignments were towards the end of the semester. Some of the Extra Credits involved reading papers and articles and writing short essays on Discrete Fourier Transform or Moore's Law which is really stupid for a CS class.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were pretty easy. If you pay attention in class and read your notes, it shouldn't be too hard to get close to a 100. Traub doesn't use a text book or post notes online, so make sure you take diligent notes - it's the only thing you can study from for the tests! Pay close attention to pros/cons of algorithms and definitions. He likes asking at least one or two of those on the exams.\r\n\r\nHe gives out an A+ to anyone who gets over 100% out of 106% in the class overall. The 6% is from the Extra credit assignments that everyone does just like normal HW.\r\n\r\nAlso, a shout out to our awesome TA, Polina. She brought an actual broad sword to class. It was pretty cool.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the Foundations track, you have to take this class. It's a stark departure from other killer classes in the track like ML, Algorithms and Complexity. However, if you're looking for a light CS class and want to learn how to discretize math problems and easily solve what math majors spend entire semesters on, this is the class for you.",

After all, you're taking Scientific Computation from the man who invented scientific computation as a serious topic of study.\r\n\r\nThen you will receive the first homework assignment. You will look at it. You will wonder if there's been some mistake. You will wonder if Prof. Traub accidentally sent his 12-year-old great-great-grandchild's homework to the TAs to copy instead of the real assignment. Why? Because the assignment instructs you to \"choose five different scientific problems and their continuous mathematical models.\" Not understand, not describe, not explain, just \"choose\". It's not a mistake, the TAs will assure you, and they will remind you not to waste your time looking for the actual equations on which these models are based.\r\n\r\nRemember that time freshman year when your Calc II class talked about Taylor series? That seventy-five minute lecture was all of SciComp. You'll talk about Taylor series the very first day, but as the days turn into weeks and the weeks into months, you'll wonder when you get to move onto something else. You don't.\r\n\r\nAt last, the final exam will be offered. The TAs will admonish you, as they did before the midterm, that decorating your blue books with animal pictures and dirty limericks may sway them to grade your answers more leniently. You will turn the page over, and feel an odd sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu. The questions on the final look familiar. They are, in fact, the very same questions that you went over during your review session a week before -- identical, coefficient for coefficient, variable for variable, word for word. Only one thing is out of place: a question asking for a brief essay on the historical origins of weather prediction.\r\n\r\nAnd it is at that moment you'll realize you've been had.

I cannot overstate what a horrible experience this has been with Traub teaching, because I love the material.  Its all about approximating functions that can't be fully solved.  Its really all very interesting, but Traub's class is a complete waste of time.  There are people always sleeping in class, its ridiculous.  Most people try to sit in the back so they don't have to look at this guy and be trying to figure out what he's trying to say.  His explanations are sooo unclear, the TA was a big help - the TA was even confused about Traub's explanations.  There were apparently 3 TAs for this class although only 1 was actually of help.  1 was a complete nuisance and the other was okay but arrogant.  All in all, the will probably have to take this class and with Traub so go find somebody's midterms.  Oh, by the way. most of the material does NOT come from the book so you need to go to class and somehow try to understand what he's trying to get across.  \"CAN WE DO BETTER???\" or as he writes it, \"CWDB\" This guy loves to abbreviate things but doesn't say what he's abbreviating, this class is a comedy show.  He's also obsessed with Google and the number of search results.  Dude, that is an approximation but he takes it way too literally.

However, is absolutely necessary to go to class, otherwise you will have no idea what is going on since he quite often teaches random topics of interest to him that are nowhere to be found in the book (though I cannot guarantee that going will actually solve this problem since many a time I have looked back at my notes for reference only to find that the three or four lines he scribbled on the board lacked context and explanation -- I learned this on the first day and therefore started writing down everything he said as well, but this still did not help). At least twice a day he will ask the class a question only to be faced with a sea of blank stares (and the course was in the middle of the day!) because nobody has a clue what he's talking about. He usually waits for a full minute or two of awkward silence before moving on. One day, we spent the whole hour and fifteen minutes discussing climate change (he honestly covered the entire board with evidence that its happening/evidence that its not happening/evidence it is caused by man/etc.) for no reason! This was a terrible waste of time, but not a single person left, probably for fear that he would stop wasting time and start covering actual material and that then they would be lost. Worst of all, the structure of the course and the depth of the material covered lead you to simply memorize a bunch of equations for the midterm and final and promptly forget it all.\r\nOverall, there are one or two nuggets of wisdom to be gained from this course, but the CS department should not make us go through an entire semester of incoherent randomness just for that!",

The first day of class we spent half the time discussing how Moore's law is the most important law in computer science. First of all... that's BS. Moore's law is an observation of fact, not a force that drives (though, granted, it did have some effect... but to call it more important than anything Turing did?). Moving on...\r\n\r\nThe man is somewhat insane. It isn't hard to do well, but he is cutting back on the extra credit. From what I hear, there used to be possible to get more than 20% of your grade be extra credit, and anyone who gets over a 100% gets an A+. Now he \"only\" gives out 16% possible extra credit. 10% of that extra credit is in the form of problems (not hard). 6% is in giving him articles from newspapers that have errors in them. The thing is, he decides how \"worthy\" the error is. I've sent him plenty of articles this semester, and only one of which was \"worthy\" of the extra credit. All of them had numerical or factual errors... it's just somewhat ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe class really is pretty darned easy. The thing is, though, you NEED to go to class and pay attention (even though it is very difficult to do so...), as his exams are based largely off lecture (e.g. what are the benefits to using the Newton method... some of the reasons are very subjective). He also gets a lot of his test problems from the homework (also, if you know someone who took the class, try to get ahold of their midterm... he tends to repeat midterm questions). Speaking of the homework, he gives out about 30+ problems over the course of the semester. All of them are fairly trivial, yet time consuming, and are downright annoying. How many times do I have to program a very trivial algorithm before its obvious that I can code? Apparently about 10 times. \r\n\r\nAgain, I still don't really get the point of this class, not to mention I don't get why it is required. There is nothing this class has taught me that I couldn't have taught myself with a little pre-calc knowledge and the knowledge I got in 1004.\r\n\r\nA hint for the midterm/final: write down a whiteboard (or something) every function you've learned up until that exam, and each function's pros/cons, and study from that. The things he tests you on are the things the homeworks are on: the same very limited applications of the functions that you see on the homeworks.",

I could hardly focus in class and, when I did, I had no idea what he was talking about. I would not dare to say this with many other professors, but with Traub, the ineffectiveness of lectures is as least as much his fault as mine. In addition, as one of the senior faculty members, Traub seems to be very into research and to have a lot of administrative duties, which may explain the quality of his teaching. On the plus side, he is a very friendly and relaxed, even somewhat fatherly to us little undergrads. Also, I imagine that, if you are a very dedicated student who reads ahead of class, knows what the lectures will be about, and makes every painstaking effort to stay awake for all 75 minutes, you should be able to understand him. (But then, given that most normal students study from the book on their own, the question will be: if you are so good, why do you have to go to class at all?)

For every assignment, he always gave us a tutorial that guids us through the whole assignment, and in it are explanations and examples that helps you complete about 75% of the work.  Then the last 25% is the actual homework.  This was really helpful.  The book is not so helpful, but his lectures are quite important but fun to attend.  He learns names of students and explains things not in some comp sci jargon but in easily understood everyday words.  Ted cracks jokes often so it's not uncommon to have the whole class burst out laughing.  The review sessions are really awesome since he gives great examples and lively demonstrations to make sure everyone understands the material.  He's really reasonable with homework also, so we actually got extensions for all the assignments.  In the end, there was even extra credit opportunities which really helped my grade.  If you can, take data structures with him!!!!",

He made Data Structures, a class I was POSITIVE was going to kill me, understandable to even the dimmest programmer. Some people in the class were annoyed by this and said he went as the pace of the dumbest kid in the class but hey, when you're the dumbest kid, you're not complaining. Seriously though, I disagree with that statement because I think Ted really cared about whether or not we learned the material. He was very understanding about homeworks and granted extensions whenever necessary, in addition to giving a VERY fair midterm and final (not easy, fair). The homeworks were time-consuming and tough but hey, this IS data structures. He went over each of them in class and made sure we knew exactly what was going on. He's a very personable man with a good sense of humor though he may weird you out in the beginning because he'll stare at you to remember your name (but he makes the effort to learn everyone's name! when's the last time an instructor of a 60 person class did that??) In conclusion, I love the man, I'd take every class with him if I could-and not just because I'm the dumbest kid in most classes. ",

This course was taught 'alongside' Prof Andoni's Analysis of Algorithms 1 course, and twice this semester Prof Stein couldn't teach and he had Andoni fill in with his own slides. After experiencing both professors, I can confidently say that Stein is much more concise, thorough, and more familiar with the material. I mean, he is a co-author of the textbook...\r\n\r\nAs far as workload, there were 6 problem sets with the lowest one dropped. These took a substantial amount of time if you actually go through the process of thinking and devising/modifying algorithms to solve them (the alternative is to google them and either find the solution posted or something similar that you can pull off as a sort-of answer). Two midterms for 25% each, and one final for 35%. First midterm I did terribly, second I did average, and final I also scored average. On the homeworks, I started off scoring 2 SD's below median, and slowly worked my way up to the median/above. Constant and steady improvement is definitely key, as I walked away with a B. \r\n\r\nThe material is challenging, but office hours are helpful. Reading the textbook is a must... especially if you miss class, you have everything you need to know in the textbook. Stein follows it perfectly, and it is written in the same language he teaches in (duh! he wrote it!), so its easy to follow along.\r\n\r\nThis class was extremely helpful for interviewing. I took it Fall 2019, as I was applying to full-time CS roles. Definitely helpful for analyzing runtime, using algorithms, modifying algorithms, optimization, etc. I recommend taking it, the topics taught in this class are extremely helpful to someone looking to be a good programmer, engineer, algorithm designer, etc.",

While I don\u2019t find Production Scheduling an inherently exciting topic, I think Cliff did a good job of trying to keep everyone engaged.\r\n\r\nThroughout the class you simply look at different scenarios and consider the best ways to schedule things to meet certain objectives. The provided textbook is quite awful, and Cliff\u2019s slides are quite bare, so you will definitely want to go to class.He mostly uses the white board in class, and uses the slides just to remind himself of the example he is about to work through. That being said, he is good at providing the intuition of how to approach the various problems, and is surprisingly good at providing a silly metaphor to help you think through the logic (e.g: \u201cif we are running a race, and you are both faster and start closer to the finish line, it is obvious who will win\u201d). \r\n\r\nHe is also very aware that this class in in senior spring for most students, so he spent some time talking about job stuff, Columbia\u2019s basketball team, etc. \r\n\r\nHis exams aren\u2019t super difficult, but they also are not boringly algorithmic. He isn\u2019t just going to give you a type of problem you have seen and ask you to apply the algorithm found in class. That might be part of the problem but then he might modify an assumption or ask a more conceptual question, so you will have to synthesize learning from other algorithms to make a slight modification to the one at hand. This shouldn\u2019t be difficult or shocking for anyone, but I guess it is slightly annoying for those in senior spring who would rather just chill out. \r\nHe has 1 homework set a week that is not particularly difficult, and usually taken less than 3 hours to do, if not less. There is a final project for this class but you define the scope of it, so to some extent, it is as much work as you want it to be, subject to limitations of course. Overall this is a somewhat boring topic, presented in a clear way, by a good professor with a low workload. \r\n",

The class definitely covers a lot of dense material, but the instructor did a great job picking out the important ideas without getting bogged down and trying to cover every last line of the textbook.  He's without question one of the best lecturers I've had at this school.  I know that often taking a class from the author of the textbook can mean that lecture notes seem like copies of the textbook, but that is not the case in this class.  I found his presentation a bit friendlier and more streamlines than the book, and he was also quite funny and brought great energy to the class.  The book could be terse, but it was definitely helpful to refer to after lectures for more details.\r\n\r\nAs people have mentioned previously, the workload is intense.  Each of the seven homework assignments are incredibly long.  I don't think I've ever spent so much time on homework assignments for a class.  I learned a ton from completing them, but they definitely could've been a bit shorter without compromising much value.  With that in mind, this is definitely not a class to undertake lightly.\r\n\r\nThe exams were much more straightforward than the assignments, and if you put a lot of effort into the assignments, it would be reflected on the exams.  It was very frustrating that so many people cheated on homework assignments for perfect scores.  I don't really have a good answer to this, as I too was very frustrated by it.  Seeing as this happened, giving a take home midterm might not have been the best idea.  The grading seemed fair to generous, especially for undergrads who were curved separately.\r\n\r\n",

                "content": "First off I enjoyed the course and think Prof. Stein is an excellent teacher. His lectures do a good job of explaining some very dense material and he also is engaging and manages to keep a relatively light tone despite the large class size. He seems well prepared and obviously is a master of the material. Sometimes when you take a course where the teacher is also the textbook author you might as well just stay home and read the book; however with this class Prof. Stein manages to add a lot of value despite covering mostly similar material to the book. The book itself is pretty good too although occasionally too terse.\r\n\r\nThe material itself is critical to any advanced CS study - either research or advanced development - and so I would recommend it to anyone looking at or already in grad school or who wants to get a highly competitive job at a top company. That said, if all you want to do is get a decent entry level CS job this material is more challenging than what you need to know.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of challenging material the class is VERY hard. Primarily this is due to the HW. With one or two exceptions each of the seven problem sets is extremely long and difficult. And (as has been pointed out) cheating is rampant. If you want to get the mean or better without cheating be prepared to invest at least twenty hours on each HW.\r\n\r\nI actually thought the midterm was great. Since the questions were brand new you couldn't cheat from the internet and so I felt the long hours I put into it were rewarded with a good score above the mean. This is in contrast to the HWs where no matter how hard I worked I generally got an average grade.\r\n\r\nI also thought the questions on the final were fair although I was surprised at my grade (which wasn't bad but wasn't good either). C'est la vie, you can't win them all. Certainly the questions on both the midterm and final are easier than on the HWs.\r\n\r\nOverall I loved the class although I think it would be even better if they reduced the amount of HW and used easier questions written from scratch each semester so people couldn't cheat from the internet. I do understand this would be a lot of work for the staff. As it stands right now hard work on the problem sets will help you learn the material very well, but can be frustrating due to sheer volume and the fact many people cheat/collaborate.\r\n\r\nCurve seemed fair to me but I haven't discussed grades with anyone else in the class. Overall TAs seemed pretty good. Some logistical hiccups (not nearly enough seats in lecture hall, HWs returned via huge pile/mad rush method) but generally grading was quick. Feedback on Piazza questions a bit skimpy but not bad.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - really enjoyed the class overall, particularly the rigorous material and good lectures. Prof is high quality. Have mixed feelings regarding the huge HWs. Textbook is relatively good.",

                "content": "I agree with the previous reviewer on almost every account.  I just want to elaborate on how some of the administrative details.  I ultimately really enjoyed the course and learned a ton.  That being said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hesitant to recommend it to anyone who is taking it just because someone told them it might be a good idea.  The workload is too heavy to undertake the course out of casual interest.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with an enormous class size, the course had a heavy focus on evaluation without much benefit.  The class had all the symptoms of a cash cow class for the master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program.  For the whole semester (except on days when homework was due), there were students filling every seat plus the stairs of the room.  The first time homework was handed back at the front of NWCB 501, the entire class fought like idiots around the tables to get their papers as quickly as possible.  Eventually, I realized that getting my homework back was pointless, as each problem rarely had any information other than the score I got on the problem.  If the score was something in between full score and no credit, they often wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother to underline or cross out the mistake.  This is a great way to give grades really quickly, but not much else.  These problems extended to both the assignments and the exams.\r\n\r\nThe professor gave a speech on the first day about the academic honesty policy, and how using the internet to help us with the homework is not allowed.  He said that violations would be treated harshly, and that there are no exceptions this policy.  He even implemented a policy to encourage us not to waste time writing anything for problems we did not know how to solve, which was to award 3 points out of 10 for leaving the problem blank.  That all seemed fine on the first day, until you realized that nobody gave a fuck and they were all just gunning for perfect scores, regardless of how they attained them.  The bottom line is that any incentives to prevent cheating were completely unsuccessful.  Yes, people who were honest were inevitably penalized. \r\n\r\nThe fact that such excessive amounts of this took place makes me question whether the expectations for the class were unreasonable.  I think most people thought to some extent that the workload was too heavy.  I think the workload did detract from learning for many students.  Yes, this is a class where doing the homework requires significant insight beyond what is presented in the lectures; this is a good thing to a certain extent but sometimes it went overboard.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the exams didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily do a good job normalizing for who was most sincere in their homework assignments.  I've been in classes before where people who cheated on the homework got killed on the exams; this was not one of those classes.  The main reason for this was that the midterm was take home (and obviously everyone collaborated).  This exam was a great deal easier than the homework assignments, but the expectations are generally a rather unclear, and the grading was much harsher than homework assignments.  Also, many of the more difficult theoretical problems did not really have anything to do with the exams.  Basically, the problem sets were so extensive that the exams weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t representative of how well students understood the assignments.  For example, much of the beginning of the course and the first two homework assignments are devoted to developing mathematical techniques, but none of this comes out on the exam.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think there should be some coordination between this class and data structures.  To put it bluntly, data structures here is a complete joke.  I think every undergrad in the class could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve benefitted from some attention to the more advanced data structures.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying this because the background was necessary or even helpful for the material we covered.",

Overall, these were some of the longest homework assignments of my life.  Some of the problems were really great and I enjoyed working through a lot of them, but it definitely was excessive.\r\n\r\n35% Take home midterm - This was 3 problems that was generally easier than the problems on homework assignments, but some of the expectations were very unclear.  For example, when we were told to give an efficient algorithm, there was one case where the most efficient algorithm was Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covered Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm yet and it was on the syllabus for a later date.  That being said, I think every CS major knows about Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  The truth (according to the solutions) was we were expected to use a less efficient algorithm than Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm because it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been covered.  These types of ambiguities weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a factor in the homework assignments because they usually indicated the runtime of the algorithm we were supposed to devise.  Also (perhaps due to unclear expectations) the grading was harsh.  The average was a 45/60 and the median was a 47/60.  \r\n\r\n35% In-Class Final - A bit of a crapshoot, and completely impossible to prepare for.  The average was a 39/60, unsurprisingly the lowest average of the semester because it was the only in class exam.  The problem with the exams wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that they were unfair so much as if you made one wrong assumption about a problem, this made it incredibly easy to mess up.  "

It is very important that you attend class, because he follows an intuitive teaching approach which can save you time as opposed to reading from the book. In other words, he does a very good job of teaching from the book without getting into the uninteresting itsy bitsy details. \n\nIf you have taken any course on algorithms before, this class might seem like a repetition. However, he teaches the material on NP completeness very well, which I think many algorithm courses don't delve deep into.\n\nThe homeworks take a lot of time, and are pretty intense, and so is the course aas a whole. But I think if you are really interested in algorithms you should take the course, but make sure you mix it with light courses.\n\n",

This wouldnt be so bad if he did everything the book way, but the problem arises because his answers that he posts online are done using the book method, even though he said his way is better and more intuitive. His lecture notes are also full of errors that he keeps saying he will fix but never does.

As with all professors he has his pros and cons.\r\n\r\nBiliris is a ball or energy and a personality in the classroom and undeniably cares about his students. He responds to questions on Piazza fairly quickly, made a point to get to know people in the class. He even joked that we could call him if going through a breakup. \r\n\r\nHe is very energetic and enthusiastic about the material and the examples, and he tends to be good at making things quite simple, so the combination is good. He also continually involves students of the classroom. He will ask for suggestions on how to solve something, ask someone else to point out flaws, etc. This keeps the room fairly engaged for a class that is 2.5 hrs long. \r\n\r\nBiliris welcomes student questions in lectures and will always stop to answer a question before moving on. This both a pro and a con. Sometimes I feel like the class got stuck because we would keep harping on an issue that was either not extremely relevant or simply repetitive. However, the good news is that, if you are willing to raise your hand, you will always walk out of class knowing what is going on. Unfortunately, Biliris sometimes either struggles to understand a student question or misinterprets the question. As such, you have to be persistent with rephrasing till he understands the question, at which point he usually does a solid job of answering.\r\n\r\nThe workload is quite light. There are 4 light homework assisgnments, two projects, a midterm and a final. The first project is significantly more in depth than the second, but the time allocated for the projects reflects that. The midterm is exactly the same in structure as the practice midterm, which makes it easy to study for. No practice final is given, and the material was harder and more technical, so make sure to spend time on Query Optimization when studying for the final. \r\n\r\nHis grading tends to be fairly generous in my view, and I think the level of CS ability in this class is lower than most other CS classes, since it is required for OR undergrads and many masters students seemed to come from weak data structures backgrounds (we spent 30 minutes discussing the complexity of a hash table). Overall, assuming you go to class and pay attention, this is a low workload class apart from projects and exams.\r\n\r\n",

We learned about functional dependencies within databases, and now I can show what a functional dependency is...but what is that within an actual database and how does this apply to SQL? We spent 2-3 lectures on the theory and underlying implementation of indexes....but didn't even touch how to actually create an index in SQL. We didn't introduce us to any of the numerous databases available (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, ...) and had us play with a variant of an Oracle database that I'm pretty sure NO ONE uses in industry. And now I'm thrown out into the real world with a hammer and I have no idea how to use it. A month later I'll probably be nailing my finger into the wall by accident.\r\n\r\nBesides that, the professor creates slides that are basically copy-pasted from the textbook (and the textbook is horrible with typos, mathematical notation gibberish with no explanation, and no real-world application mentions). He hates taking questions, his TAs are half of the time absent from their OHs, and he obviously doesn't care about the class. I guess he's funny though (if you like \"haha wow I can't believe I'm sitting in this classroom funny\").\r\n\r\nIf you plan on taking this course I recommend the following advice.\r\n\r\n1) Never go to class, and just read the textbook.\r\n2) The textbook is horrible so find online slides, lecture videos, and other SQL/databases notes to actually understand the textbook\r\n\r\nWhat does this advice mean?

But overall I wouldn't describe Biliris and this class as awful. His lectures are 2.5 hour long rambles, but not without comical interludes. His jokes are often funny, and he gives a ten minute break in the middle of class, which often extended to fifteen. Having said that, you can manage even without ever going to class, so apart from the few jokes there's very little value addition by his lectures.\r\nThe class material itself is interesting. It c, ould have been presented better (He reuses slides from several years ago, and doesn't even change the semester in the footer), but he has his limitations in teaching ability, and so you just need to make do with it. The four homework assignments are fairly easily. The projects can take time, but if your partner isn't completely lost, you can divide up the work and finish it over the course of a night. The exams are both fair, but of course, there's thinking involved, so it's easy to panic if things aren't going your way.\r\nIf you're not a CS major, I'd recommend to buy the book. His lecture slides are essentially a summary of the book, but there are some concepts that aren't very clearly explained in his slides. If you were sleeping in class (or absent, like I was), the slides will be of very little help in such instances.\r\nI can't say whether Biliris genuinely cares about this class or not, but he definitely gives the impression that he cares about the students. In our first class, he announced that we could call him up at any time before 11PMexcept if we were going through a breakup, in which case he said feel free to call me even after.\r\nIn summary: his lectures are pointless.

Read his lectures that he posts online (takes about 30 min) and save yourself the other 2 hours. I can't stress enough how useless his lectures were. It's basically like taking a class online, you just have to show up for the midterm and final. The material is actually extremely useful and somewhat interesting.\r\n\r\nLuckily though, the material is easy and there's not much of it. There's a grand total of 10 short lectures (only 9 of them are tested on), compared to other classes that have about 25 a semester. The average won't be that high because you're with a bunch of IEOR majors and grad students that don't know how to program. The 4 homeworks can be tricky at times, but honestly not too bad.\r\n\r\nThe group projects are relatively easy and straightforward. You just have to demonstrate that your projects contain every concept that was taught in class, regardless of whether or not your Database schema will benefit with it (i.e. Aggregation is great in theory, but NOBODY puts it into practice in their database. it makes things painfully redundant and difficult. but since we learned it in class, you'll lose a substantial amount of points if you don't have aggregation in your database). Don't bother making your project look pretty or have much functionality. As long as you demonstrate the concepts that were in class, you'll get full credit. The median on project 2 was 49/50, if that says anything to you.\r\n\r\nYou have a total of 6 late days, 3 for the individual homeworks, in total, and 3 for the projects, in total. So clutch.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final are straightforward. If you know relational algebra, SQL, and the concepts, you'll do fine. And let me remind you, DON'T GO TO HIS LECTURES.",

His lectures were a complete waste of time. He would crap on and on about some simple concept in the most unintelligible way for an hour at a clip. I can honestly say that I did not learn anything substantial from this class. By the sixth week half of the students did not show up or left at the break. By the fourteenth week it was more like 80%. The material was presented with no context and no depth. I could have taught this class better than he did, and I do not have near the amount of database and teaching experience as he does.\r\n\r\n2) I ended up doing all of the group work by myself because my partner was so lost. I cannot blame him considering the lectures were essentially black holes. If I had not had database experience prior to this course I would have probably been as lost as my partner, who had none.\r\n\r\n3) A bit of the material was out of date. This happens in CS classes often, but it was particularly bad in this class. I think the textbook we were using was from 2003.\r\n\r\n4) We were forced to use Oracle for our projects, which was a nightmare. Oracle is one of the most bloated and hard to learn database systems around. Why we would use Oracle and not MySQL (very popular, modern, and easy to use) is beyond me.\r\n\r\n5) Biliris does not understand English well enough to teach a course. He can hold a conversation, but he cannot explain complex ideas. He did not understand questions asked by students and he often hid this by making fun of them.\r\n\r\n6) The grading in this class was ridiculous. Often points were taken off if we did not answer a question exactly how the TAs thought we should have, despite those requirements not being specified in the assignment description. Each homework and test problem was graded by a different TA, which meant you had to contact many TAs if you had questions about more than one problem. This was incredibly inconvenient.\r\n\r\n7) My assigned TA had worse English skill than Biliris, which made him useless to me.",

Generally speaking, the portions of the assignment that take 80%+ of the time spent coding are the parts that are irrelevant to the material being taught by the homework.  For example, the homework assignment involving trees and hierarchies was easy enough conceptually, but the mechanics of getting the applet to display the way you wanted were a royal pain in the posterior.  This shows inexperience and some obliviousness.\n\nHowever, the man isn't uncaring.  A little begging post-thanksgiving convinced him to extend the deadline of one of the homework assignments, and he seems very approachable and eager to help.

Even the final was only an hour and a half with 4-5 questions. "

He seemed keen and interested and in love with the various aspects of security. Also felt his research shone through his lectures as well as his breadth of knowledge in different aspects of networking (like knowledge of SIP) and security. \r\n\r\nI felt the course was interesting in a whole, covers crypto, javascript attacks, firewalls, SPAM analysis etc. I felt though there could have been more emphasis on OS attacks, overflows especially since the Prof. Angelos was the lecturer for Operating systems too.\r\n\r\nIn terms of languages C/C++ was the main choice for the first couple of assignments, then there was some javascript and then some shell scripts for firewall and spam analysis (AWK scripts etc.). \r\n\r\nThe TA (Georgios Kontaxis) was very sharp too, and had super fast response time to emails even at the most odd hours of the night. Good on him.\r\n\r\nI would rate this class 5/5 and the professor 5/5. I would also think its a great elective to take even if you are working on some other major. I think you would get a great overview of different aspects of security, and I think this is probably better than lot of other courses, in terms of interesting assignments and great lecturer.\r\n\r\nI thought the mid-term and final were decent, the final being slightly harder (its more about understanding the different concepts in security rather than any regurgitation).

                "content": "I'll be blunt: Angelos Keromytis is not a good instructor. He might be pretty smart and know his stuff, but he just has no idea how to be a professor (sometimes literally; there was a period of 5 or 6 classes where I didn't see him at all and the TAs taught both the lab and lecture classes). \r\n\r\nA good professor spends time crafting detailed but concise slides with concrete, succinct examples; Keromytis copies code off the web and pastes them into his slides as if they were his own. (Seriously, Google the code. You'll find the exact same contrived examples online that only seldom work; most of the time they'll only serve as basic skeletons of what you need to do to get your code to compile.)\r\n\r\nA good professor is welcoming and encourages student participation and questions; Keromytis is intimidating and sometimes even humiliates students. For example, about 3/4ths of the way through the course, when a student wasn't sure how to change permissions on a file, instead of replying something reproaching but nevertheless sane such as, \"Use the chmod command, as we've been doing for the past two months,\" Keromytis responded, \"Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?\" This is not a good way to encourage students to keep asking questions. As if asking questions helped most of the time (see next paragraph).\r\n\r\nA good professor teaches and presents students concepts and ideas; Keromytis' ego comes across more than his material, and when asked questions, tells you to just look at the man page. Due to both the nature of this course and the professor's incomplete slide examples and his poor teaching abilities, you'll have a lot of questions about what to do. However, half the time when asked something about a particular C function or paradigm, either on Courseworks discussions or in class, Keromytis will just tell you to refer to the man page. While I understand that this class is supposed to mold you into a competent programmer who is fearless of elaborate technical documentation, there is something worthwhile about having a human being explain something to you rather than just reading it online or on a man page, and a good professor shouldn't just tell you to refer to something else nearly all the time. ..Although this professor might be an exception. I feel like I've learned more through Stack Overflow than Keromytis could ever hope of teaching me.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the only saving grace in this class were the two TAs. They seem to be the only ones that cared about us. They would take the time to read through our code line-by-line, helping us find bugs, and they would actually help clarify concepts. Their accents were a bit hard to get through at first, and the English and grammar in the assignments were sometimes confusing (since they wrote them all), but they mean no harm and will gladly clarify if you ask. Not to mention if you write to them about a specific bad grade you received and give reasonable arguments for why you think you deserved more credit, they will entertain your request, and if you present a good enough argument, this usually entails you getting at least one or two points back.\r\n\r\nI might sound bitter, but don't think this is because I got a bad grade. I didn't. Keromytis is just an astoundingly poor specimen of a professor. I got a good grade in the class, but it was due to my own hard work and the hours I put into labs and homeworks. I wish I could say Keromytis helped me along the way. I can't.",

The first one was intense and took some time, but the following two felt like they could have been labs and were much shorter. Note however: you will be pressed for time throughout the course. You need to eat, sleep, and breathe Advanced Programming (especially if you take it concurrently with Data Structures--a poor choice, in my opinion. Both have heavy workloads). Whenever you have spare time, work on your lab and homework. Especially during weeks when homeworks are due, since these would often be due 2-3 days after a lab, in order to keep the labs on schedule.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final are both in the CLIC lab and are programming assignments. Midterm was doable (avg 68%) but final was difficult (avg 59%). It had two parts, one in C and one in PHP. The C part relied on one concept we learned for basically one lecture, and if this didn't work, the entire part wouldn't work. Protip for exams: when you reach bottlenecks like this, stop messing with it and spend your time wisely by coding other features, even though they may not be testable due to the aforementioned bottleneck. If your code is right, you'll at least get a few points for it. "

Keromytis is much worse than that. He's more like a swimming teacher who throws you into a huge pool of acid, then just randomly rambles on about the Summer Olympics. In his lectures, he was always talking about new concepts without introducing them first. Example: one day he was talking about page faults, as if everyone knew what a page fault was. But he had never talked about page faults or pages in class before. I raised my hand and asked \"What's a page fault?\" He said, \"Oh, that's right, I haven't talked about pages yet. I meant to say 'TLB miss', not 'page fault' \". OK, fair enough. But then, a few minutes later, he used the term \"page fault\" again. He STILL hadn't introduced the concept of pages. You need to be aware of what you're saying... Don't assume we know these things, we don't all have like 8 million PhD degrees in CS like you. It's a CLASS. We're there to LEARN. That means most of us didn't know anything about this crap at the beginning of the semester.\n\nKeromytis is one of the many professors at Columbia whose teaching skills were NOT taken into consideration at all when Columbia decided to hire him. If Columbia decided jobs based on teaching skills, Angelos would be fired tomorrow. Basically, he got hired mainly because he's good at acquiring money for the university through research grants.  Learn how to run a class. Oh, wait, I guess you never will learn that.. Columbia has tons of professors who were hired like this. All the most selective colleges in America (the \"top-tier\" colleges) do. It's a serious problem with the American academic world today.

You do surprisingly little coding, which is ironic for a \"software engineering\" course. Writing \"cool\" software won't score you more points in the class. If you absolutely must take this course, do not be ambitious about the projected you will create. You won't receive extra points because your project is \"cool\" or \"harder.\" Most of your grade hangs on the writing/documentation you do -- and you will spend more time on this than anyone would want to. So make your software easy to document and easy to test. You really only spend a month or two working on it, the rest is over-excessive planning you don't end up following anyway.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final will have you writing so much stuff! The first of the three questions test you on vocabulary (!) terms from the lectures/book. The second one is short answers. The last one asks you to come up with designs for proposed software and ask you to write more than what most people can do in the given time. If you take this course, do the test backwards. Almost everything in the course is pedestrian stuff you know already: unit tests, version control, software testing, etc. The other stuff you might not have heard of, UML diagrams, burn-down charts, and spike testing, etc, are not complicated at all, and can easily be learned from the textbook. (http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Software-Development-Pilone/dp/0596527357). In undergrad, I went to a much less prestigious school than Columbia, and I never had a course this boring, simple, and tedious. I was really in for a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe redeeming feature of the course is that the teacher an the TAs (the one's we had) were all nice people. (not necessarily easy graders though!) The textbook is actually read from cover to cover and is actually affordable. However, you shouldn't take a course just because the textbook is cheap and the teacher is nice.\r\n\r\nI was initially attracted to this course because I thought I would spend most of the time coding a cool project.

DO YOU INTEND TO LEARN THAT AFTER PAYING SO MUCH in this course at COLUMBIA ...an Ivy league university?\r\nYou will be made to produce a paper for mid term that constitutes half of your whole semester grade.

Afterall thats what  you paid for to learn at Columbia? (Do some scaling, lining, put references etc..and let prof speak some history for half a semester....) If you by chance happen to visit Jonathan Bell and ask for why you got a C or B or something in between, he will search through that report and say, your heading was bold when it should have been italic..or your paper is not strongly supporting this or that.....what the fuck...?You paid tuition for that?and after NOT LEARNING ANYTHING FOR A SEMESTER...you get a C to B. Another half of semester you will end up doing some project OF YOUR CHOICE and demoing in class what you did etc. TEACHER was suppose to teach and that never happened...and now you find yourself suddenly giving presentation in front of class on something....\r\n\r\nWaste of tuition and a poor grade. \r\nYou wont learn anything in this course, because she wont teach you. Moreover if you happen to not please them in presentation or in project, you will get a POOR GRADE that will cost you GPA and later jobs.\r\n\r\nJonathan Bell is an asshole TA who has a BIG EGO. He rejoices in screwing people's grades and nothing else. He can never agree to anything you say or propose. It should strictly adhere to what he thinks is best and what he likes. If that is not the case, you lose grade and points. Why does Columbia even allow Gail Kaiser to take classes? and what do students learn after taking her classes? All her courses share same story and I was victim....\r\nAtleast you dont become one....and please please drop this course....take something else somewhere if not at Columbia.....if you have to...but dont take this course....you will repent all your life for having taken this course under Gail Kaiser with Jonathan Bell as TA.\r\n",

However, her lectures tend to be very dry and not very helpful, and the course materials aren't any better.  The course skims over component model frameworks, software testing and various software quality assurance techniques, but doesn't really go deep enough to make things useful.  Most of these topics are covered briefly in lecture, and then exercised in a group project where they become a passing thought when completing your documentation.  By the end, you'll learn that you should do 'xx' and 'yy' if you're working in the software industry on a big project, but will be unsure as to what exactly qualifies as 'xx' or 'yy'. \r\n",

The work required and assignment specs were all laid out pretty clearly at the beginning of the semester, which was really refreshing, actually. Most of the other C.S. classes I've been in don't make specifications for assignments available until 1-3 weeks before they come due; it's hard to plan a semester that way.\n\nI'd say the course is intended to give a flavor of how web technology is used and how it developed -- up to and including the state of the art -- and it works well in that regard. A lot of information goes by quite fast, especially by the end, but students don't have to do all that much with lectures that don't relate to their project and paper, as there aren't exams.",

His accent isn't really an issue, but he has a way of failing to frame the question that's motivating what he's talking about; you get no sense of what he's building towards. He also doesn't speak very confidently; it's hard to tell whether he's entertaining a possibility for class discussion or actually saying that this is an accepted practice.\n\nThe lectures tailed off in quality by the end of the course (as did attendance, precipitously); some of the lectures got into mathematical details well beyond the requirements of the course and well beyond what most people in the class could readily understand.\n\nAs far as slides go: the slides were a fair basis for looking things up on the internet later, but no better.\n\nThe course was well organized insofar as the assignments go; the course fell down in other respects. The assigned readings in the main textbook (Computer Graphics by Peter Shirley) often had only a tentative relationship to our lectures, and their pedagogical approach was very, very different; it's a good book, but was useless for the class. Other assigned readings included big swaths from the OpenGL red book -- hundreds of pages in all. Fortunately, I think most of us were smart enough to know that one doesn't learn a programming API that way. Another example: the materials and lectures we were given on curves weren't really sufficient to understand the second assignment; my partner and I had to use online course notes from another university. (Reading up on curves in one of the optional texts would have done the trick too.)\n\nThe overall impression that I got, really, was that Professor Ramamoorthi viewed teaching the class as a chore, offloaded much of the work in running the class to our TA (actually writing up the assignment specifications, etc.), and didn't do a number of small things that would have improved the class greatly.",

First, he really, really knows his stuff; thus he was never unsure about anything and knew exactly what he was going to talk about. He even had review sessions in which over things he knew we would be confused about. Second, he is responsible. The clarity of his lecture notes reflect the effort and time he spent in preparation, as well as the very well-designed homework assignments. Third, although he is strict about extensions and the like, he is crystal- clear about rules and requirements; you have noone to blame but yourself for not doing well. He also made it clear in the first day of class that Graphics would not be easy. It turned out to be challenging but not that difficult in terms of grading, and fun as well. (Off-topic: don't you hate seeing reviews that say \"I got a B and I don't know why. He's a bad professor\"? I've read a lot on CULPA recently.

Yes, the proofs are a little tiresome at first, but as we progressed in the course, I thought the proofs started to get more creative and I got the hang of it more.

Another issue that I found out in the second half of the term is that I was getting too caught up in the fine details of what was being taught in the lecture and wasn't really getting a full picture. But taking a step back from the material to see the larger picture, especially during the Turing Machine section, helped immensely. \nEven though I struggled with just about everything in the course, I would recommend taking it with Tal because she is super intelligent and is really helpful and approachable in office hours. I only went to her office hours towards the end of the class because I thought she would be somewhat intimidating but this was not the case at all. Some, myself included, found her intimidating in class because she would sometimes answer student's questions with \"I'm not sure where your getting confused\" which can be awkward for the student asking the question but Tal doesn't mean it with an ill intention. So, if you can get over this bit you should be fine or go to her OH and ask in a smaller setting. \nI'm not sure how this course will be structured when we go back to campus but the format was three unit tests worth 30%, 30%, 10% of your final grade. I got somewhat below average on all of them - nothing by more than 5% less than average - but did fine on the homework (except for one where I got 50! lol) and the quizzes and ended up with a B+ so the curve is really generous. For context, the averages for the tests in fall 2020 were around 70% each time and I genuinely thought I had failed the second test which was worth 30% yike. \nWith all that being said, I do think that the homework grading can be inconsistent and sometimes (rare for me at least though) just doesn't make sense. Grading is not always inconsistent, but it certainly feels shitty when something unfortunate like that happens to you. But, as long as you go to office hours when confused you should be able to get some helpful pointers about where to start - some TAs are more helpful than others so best to figure that out in the beginning of the term. \nThis class was one of those courses where I disliked it during the course but reflecting on it, it wasn't so bad. That is a strong argument for not taking the course though...\nTLDR: The curve will save you even if you feel like you are failing.",

You many find this course \"hard\", or \"uninteresting\", if you thought ML is \"cool\", or the sole image of Machine Learning in your head is from ML class by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This is a very maths based course, and he mentions this in the first class, and urges people to drop if they can't handle it. I guess it is fair on his part, to announce that the maths will be slighty tough, I wouldn't say even tough, just different. This course will help you a lot, if you want to read Machine Learning papers, do research in the field, because there is some very odd notation involved and the course will teach you that.

No matter how much Prob/Stats or Linear Algebra or just MATH in general you *think* you know, you're not ready for this course (especially if you're an undergrad.. if you're a superstar Ph.D student, make your own judgement).  For example, on one of the homeworks, we were asked to perform vector calculus, which is usually not covered in any of the prerequisites. Another example is when we were asked to do multiple indefinite integrals of a particularly long formula, by hand, during a midterm as a problem worth 20% of the grade.\r\n\r\n2. He goes through very few examples in class, (and when he does, only a select few understand him) which means that most of the homework problems you have absolutely no idea how to do, even if you took the best notes humanly possible in his incredibly dull lectures. For this reason, academic honesty in its strictest definition (no looking through internet for answers, no collaboration on homeworks) is nowhere to be found, because it is impossible to do 90% of the workload in this class otherwise.\r\n\r\n3. He can't teach. I will leave it at this because no other words can describe how truly bad he is.\r\n\r\n4. Since this isn't an absolute requirement for any tracks (even for AI, you can take much better courses such as Spoken Language Processing), you can do yourself a favor and take this same course on Coursera or other excellent online alternatives if you would really like to learn Machine Learning. This is more ideal since Jebara's class is the least efficient place to do any learning.\r\n\r\n5. http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/ Look at his picture.

Like many others, I had to rely on online lectures from Stanford to build a proper understanding of many concepts covered in the class.

You need good teammates to decide on the project features together and implement them together.\n\n- I understand that Edwards tries to teach a lot, which is why we have individual assignments, midterm (normally, it was canceled this sem), final, a monster project, a ~250 page final paper on the project... but man, this is a lot of work. If you're not ready to put in the hours, don't take this class.\n\n- Docker and OCaml can be very frustrating, but they will uncover new areas of software development for you.\nAdvice:\n\n- Test everything. He won't accept anything that's not tested.\n\n- Start the project early.\n\n- Edwards is snarky, don't take it to heart.\n\n- If the assigned TA is useless, stop wasting your time meeting with them immediately.\n\n- Trust Edwards in that when he's giving project advice, he's thinking the best for you. He's also not out to get you in the exams.",

I took both of his classes, and I thought he adopted to the online format very well (he makes great use of Zoom's chat feature for questions). He is incredibly organized, cares a lot about his classes and his students, and has some outstanding TAs (Ben Flin and Hans Montero were amazing). Not to mention, he is one of the only Professors in the CS department who actually tries to get to know undergraduates in his classes! I really appreciated this and feel like I actually know him now.\nOh, and did I mention that Prof. Edwards is absolutely hilarious? I think the quotes above will suffice, but his slides have great memes, his Facebook might be the most entertaining of any Professor's, and he is incredibly witty. If you enjoyed Donald Ferguson's snarky humor, Professor Edwards is for you; if you have a thin skin, you might want to stay away, since he will absolutely sass you back. I, personally, think it is wonderful, and I think most people do as well.\nAs for the actual classes, Parallel Functional Programming is an introduction to programming in Haskell. The first half is sequential Haskell and the second half is parallel Haskell. Haskell is nothing like other programming languages you have been exposed to (unless you have taken PLT and are used to OCaml), and it probably does warrant an entire course since it forces you to think in an entirely new way. There are 5 HW assignments and a medium-workload final project that you spend the last month or so on and do in groups of 2. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a chill class, even if they aren't on the systems track (Edwards has said this is similar to a 41xx class).\nProgramming Languages and Translators is an introduction to Compilers, and for many students, functional programming with OCaml. I was at the advantage of having taken PFP beforehand so this wasn't a huge jump for me, but it is for many. You also learn some theory. There are 3 light-ish HW asignments, a final, and a very heavy group project that you do in teams of 3-5. Pick a good group!\nI believe both classes were curved to a B+, so it is very possible to do well. I cannot recommend Prof. Edwards any more than I already have; seriously, take a class with this man! If for nothing else, the memes are worth it.",

Some issues with the curriculum: we spent way too long on things like DFAs, NFAs, and regexes, which are covered pretty fully in CST, which is a prerequisite for this class, so that was a bit of a waste of time.  We also spent a bit too long on covering code generation, which became repetitive, so we did have to rush a bit at the end.  But codegen is really important for the project, so it shouldn't be ignored, but spending ~5 classes on MicroC codegen was a bit much.\nEdwards is a great lecturer.  He's very funny and presents the material in a way that makes it very conducive to picking it up rapidly (or wickedly fast, as he would say).  His lectures were actually a joy to go to.\nThe best part of this class imo is the project, though.  One of the most rewarding pieces of work I've done at Columbia.

His office hours are really helpful and his HW assignments and exams are reasonable (most questions are basically the same as the HW questions except for one or two. The slides are super helpful and it was a good class to take over Zoom because I was able to rewatch a bunch of his lectures if I was ever confused. He's a pretty good lecturer, except that on Zoom he lets and encourages people to make random show-offy comments with inside CS jokes that are distracting, annoying, wastes time, and makes everyone who doesn't get them feel dumb for not knowing the conventions of some obscure language. We get it, Matthew Ottomano, you know Haskell.\nIn terms of the group project, it's very tricky, and you don't really get taught the material you need to do it until after you had to do it, and even once we learned the theoretical part of what we were doing, it was really hard to translate that to what we were implementing. Basically, you're very much on your own for figuring out to add features to your language beyond a basic C like language you're given as a starting point. For our group it wasn't too bad, but it's mostly because one of the people in our group clearly understood everything way better than the rest of us did and did a ton of the work. I'm not saying the rest of the group were slackers, everyone tried hard and put in a lot of hours, but we'd struggle to pair program a feature for hours and then the other person in our group would have just fixed it and also miraculously added a bunch of other features by the next time we talked. That said, the group you are with is super important. I don't have great tips about how to find a good group. Someone who you think is super smart is not necessarily the best teammate. It helps if you've worked together before and understand their workflow and work ethic. It's pretty cool to have a finished product by the end, but I don't even know how much of it I understand beyond the features I implemented. Actually even those I feel like I kind of stumbled around in the dark in making them, so I don't know if I actually understand them either.\nFinally, the TAs were not great in the class. One was fired apparently half way through the semester, some didn't seem to know Ocaml or really how to help with the project. I think it was partially because Edwards hadn't taught the class in a while, so he didn't have a super solid group of TAs that had taken his version, which I understand, but was kind of frustrating. \nOverall, this wasn't the worst class, and I would generally recommend taking it with Edwards. Your group will be the main determining factor on your experience taking the class, though.",

On the side note, he also brings in \"Stephen Colbert\" style humors in class which can be quite entertaining at times.\r\nThe project is the centerpiece of this class. It allows you to build a programming language on your own from scratch. This can be a great experience because you are dissecting every component of the building blocks of a modern programming language. \r\nMuch has been written about OCaml which is the language used in the project. But half way through the semester, everyone realizes that due to its very important features like pattern matching and strict type referencing, OCaml is simply the best language for building a programming language in a semester long period. There is also a huge inventory of past projects done in OCaml in the class website that can be very useful reference. Some people who had taken this class with Professors other than Edwards often ran into challenges due to lack of resources and reference materials. \r\nI highly recommend taking this course with Professor Edwards. Make sure to find  good teammates and make use of past projects as a guide. You will end up with a great project and your own programming language.

                "content": "Stay away from Edwards, go with Aho. Edwards recommends Aho himself. Also, Aho's famous because he's the A in AWK and wrote the Dragon book. The only thing you'll miss in Aho's class is Edwards' sense of humor.\r\n\r\nEdwards is the snarkiest, most sarcastic, immature professor you will meet in the CS department. He tells some really great nerdy jokes and his Facebook wall is hilarious since he belittles all his students publicly on it, but I don't recommend taking his class. Don't ever email him with an excuse or stupid question since he will publicly shame you (name removed though) on Facebook.\r\n\r\nI didn't learn much in the course. The material was pretty straight forward, nothing really complicated like you would see in more theoretical CS classes. You sort of get a high level understanding of how a compiler works and that's about it. If you did most of the work for your project, you will learn more mostly by reading on your own to save your project and not because you learned anything from this class. \r\n\r\nHis exams are reasonably easy but the problem is everyone gets high scores. The median on the midterm was like a 94. If you screwed up even a little bit, you were done for. You don't have to know all the material in the slides - most of it is to build the compiler. He posts review slides the class before the exam. You just need to know the stuff on them. Check out the last semester slides on his website to peek ahead. Grading was harsh and he often cuts points for really dumb reasons. Make sure your HW is perfect if you want a good score.\r\n\r\nThe project is KILLER. In all likelihood, you will fail if you don't assemble the Avengers to be your team. Make sure you put together a strong team which has time to commit to this project. The project is structured such that one person (the most responsible or the least busy) always ends up doing over 50% of the work. We've looked at other groups and previous teams and this is the case through out. I think Edwards should take a look at this and somehow fix the project so that it's more fair.\r\n\r\nSome tips: Start early!!! Get the scanner and parser out of the way quickly. You can copy most of them from last year's groups and just modify them to your liking. He doesn't really teach you enough to write the compiler till 3/4ths of the way into the semester but don't wait for that since you'll get screwed. Semantic checking and code generation take a ton of time to complete. Start early and be sure to pester the TAs for help. Also, half of you team will be slackers and you will lose all faith in humanity. You just have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't make expectations on the project clear at all, so I'm going to break it down for you here. You need to turn in your proposal 2-3 weeks into class. Get started with the scanner and parser ASAP. Then turn in your language reference manual which says what your language will look like. Then code up the rest of your compiler and put together some tests. Our group ended up writing 70% of our language during reading week and finishing the slides for our final presentation and the project report during finals week. Needless to say, my other exams got screwed in the process.",

                "content": "This review is for Edwards and for the SUMMER version of PLT. There is no summer review of him on here so for those of you who were curious, read on!\r\n\r\nEdwards is, plain and simple, the shit. He is quite possibly the most organized professor I have ever seen. His website contains every class of PLT he has taught for the most part including old projects, slides, and documents. Furthermore, his notes are outstanding. In that regard, he has basically done all the work for you. The material is complex at heart but his notes and his descriptions in class make that material very easy to digest. Furthermore, it is evident in every shape and form that he absolutely loves and cares about the material. This man is among the nerdiest to ever exist and he definitely knows his stuff inside and out and forwards and backwards and I feel like he was very effectively in conveying this passion in his lectures. In addition to learning about making a language, you will also learn cool tidbits like C history, language history, or operational details you might not have known about various languages. Edwards is also a total language hipster and spent the first day of class openly trashing Java, C++, and many others (he called Perl an \"abomination\"). Therefore, if you are waiting for his endorsement of the \"cool and underground language you haven't heard of, maaaaaan\" then you will find it with OCaml (more on that in a second).\r\n\r\nThe summer class had two homeworks which were both incredibly easy. The notes will tell you everything you need to know and he doesn't pull any cheap shots; if you pay attention in class and understand the notes then you will be able to breeze through the assignments.\r\n\r\nHowever, the homeworks are only 10 percent of your grade. A whopping 50 percent of your grade comes from a massive project wherein you have to make your own programming language. The other 40 comes from the final exam (no midterm) which, while a little tricky, wasn't too bad.\r\n\r\nThe project itself MUST be done in a language called OCaml which I had never heard of before taking this class. OCaml is quite possibly the most annoying language you will ever use if only because it has the most frustrating and nitpicking compiler I have ever seen......but the good news is that most of the time once it compiles then it works the way you want it to. Personally, I prefer to write code that blows up, analyze it, and then fix it (and isn't that the purpose of test suites anyway?) but you will have no such luxury with OCaml. Furthermore, it has very unhelpful error messages; it is fairly difficult to ascertain the problem when the only indication of what you did wrong is something like \"Syntax Error\" or \"Expression was 'a * 'b * 'c but was expecting type 'a * 'b list\" (and what the fuck exactly is a 'b list?!?!? I just finished the class and I still don't know). If you thought \"Segmentation Fault\" was bad just wait until you get a load of this. Still, Edwards makes the point that OCaml is an easy language to write compilers in and once you start getting good at it you will see where he is coming from. The language itself is fairly powerful and you can do quite a lot with only a few lines. As annoying as OCaml was I am glad that we had to use it if only to a) learn a new language and b) gain the new perspective and discipline from programming in it. It is also interesting to learn a new language when taking a class dissecting what makes a language \"good\".\r\n\r\nSTART EARLY ON THE PROJECT. The class is 6 weeks long and goes by faster than you'd ever believe. My team and I were pretty good at staying on point throughout but I can very easily see how the project can be a nightmare if you wait until the last minute and doubly so if the team hasn't practiced with OCaml. There were other teams demoing with barely finished languages who appeared to make that mistake; don't let it be you.\r\n\r\nThe only complaint I have about this class is the time we spent covering Prolog. While it is an interesting language to learn about, I don't know why he spent the time he did covering unification and searching considering AI is already a class here. This part of the class seemed completely out of place and irrelevant next to anything else we had done all summer. There was even a Prolog question on the final exam. It seemed rather pointless to have this question on the final, which is supposed to test my knowledge of programming languages and translators, covering an AI topic and making it worth 10 points.\r\n\r\nLastly, a word of warning: Edwards is a very direct person and is quick to criticize or otherwise shoot down your ideas for your project. Don't take it personally. At first he hated my idea too.",

If we can do that then there's no reason for you to fear it. As long as you coordinate effectively with your team and you don't procrastinate it's a breeze. I can see how the contrary can easily become a nightmare.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to clear up the misconception that PLT is one of the hardest classes in CS here. That isn't true at all (at least not with Edwards). The key to success in this class lies, as opposed to many other classes I've taken at Columbia, entirely on you. You've got to put in the work but considering the time it isn't that bad and it will pay off.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend taking this over the summer if you can. "

His lecture style is very straightforward: he is one of the most rational and simplistic presenters of complex material I have ever encountered.  If I had to take PLT, I would do so with Edwards.  He introduces LogiSim, which Rubenstein does not.  I told several of Rubenstein's students about LogiSim and it made their lives much easier.\r\n\r\nBut really I'm writing this review because of Edwards' personality and humor.\r\n\r\nEdwards is a geek's geek.  Perhaps he doesn't look like one, but he dresses like one and behaves like one.  I find this enjoyable in a professor, but for some it may be an acquired taste, like Scotch whiskey.\r\n\r\nSome co-engineers of mine have pointed out that he can be rude, surly, and dismissive.  I think these attributes seem to present themselves because he is rational above all else, and has a limited amount of time.  (~2 orders of magnitude below Temple Grandin. Let's say the average engineer is about 4 below, Vallancourt is 6 below, and the average art history major is 10 below.)\r\n\r\nI don't think he has ever been rude to me, but in the sense of being hyper-analytical without regard to feelings, Edwards has a tendency to do this.  And I personally find it liberating, assuming I am capable of keeping my ego out of the equation.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say he equates human interactions to a set of logic gates, but in dealing with assignments and career advice, don't expect a lot of small talk or beating-about-the-bush.  Professor Edwards is one of the most direct human beings I have ever encountered.\r\n\r\nIf you need to prove to yourself that he has a soft/creative/dynamic side, keep in mind the following:\r\n\r\n * He modeled for McDonald's in Taiwan\r\n * He bought a vintage PacMan arcade machine and drove it to his office from AC\r\n * He makes bad jokes that pertain to driving even though no one drives in New York\r\n * He wears a fanny pack when he bicycles to and from Mudd\r\n\r\nI may not be the most adept engineer in SEAS, but I thoroughly appreciate Edwards' awkward and dryly amusing brand of brilliant.\r\n",

Shit, after taking this class as a postbac, I was accepted to both Columbia and Penn for a Masters in CS, so I guess it worked out. His class will give you the A or A+ you need, presuming he grades you properly and submits appropriate grades. For me, that presumption turned out to be false. \r\n\r\nThe issue involved the professor giving me a B+ when I deserved and had been graded with an A. The reason for this problem was minor - I had been granted a written extension to turn in a final project, I turned the assignment in based on that timeline, and had received a zero by error of the professor. The professor agreed that I deserved an A for the class after grading my final assignment.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple communication attempts with him and spending over two months on the issue, the professor did not submit a grade change. He acknowledged the grade I had received was an A, but was either too busy/lazy to change it over basically the entire summer. This created deep stress for me, and concerned me, especially because I intended to apply for masters programs the next semester.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I brought my advisor in to help resolve the issue. After she confirmed the appropriate grade with the professor, she waited several weeks for the professor to resolve the issue. He didn't. She fixed the issue herself by submitting a document to change the grade.\r\n\r\nI believe this professor is an unfortunate member of the Columbia community, and is one of several reasons why I decided to attend Penn instead of Columbia for my masters program.

They were often very ambiguous about fundamental questions, like whether we had to write our own data structures, or whether a GUI was required.\r\n\r\nI felt the programming assignments were just a filler, and didn't enhance my understanding of data structures at all. The theory problems were better, but grading was unclear and didn't help me learn.\r\n\r\nGrading wise it seemed like the TAs and Shlomo did the only thing they could do, give everyone lots of points so they wouldn't complain.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was very easy. The final was easier, and at the last minute he decided to make it open book/open note. \r\n\r\nThe textbook we used, Weiss' Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java, was pretty bad.

I've had worse (*cough* Dawn Strickland *cough*) professors in the CS department. This class covered all that it should cover. You will gain a functional knowledge of all basic data structures. He also gave us a high level overview of more advanced data structures like AVL and Splay trees, Cuckoo hashing, rainbow tables, min-max heaps, max-flows, etc. The number of topics this class covers makes dealing with Shlomo worth it. You will definitely learn more in this class than in 3134.\r\n\r\nShlomo is a poor to average teacher. He often rushes through explanations and sometimes gets facts wrong. His teaching is good enough to understand the subject though. You will learn a good deal about cool data structures and algorithms, though it can be painful putting up with Shlomo.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this class a mess is the fact that he is totally disorganized. He initially told us that we would have 7 theory and 5 programming assignments - we ended up with 5 and 3 (which was plenty of HW given the length of each assignment). Homeworks were often vague with lots of errors, though you can clarify doubts on Piazza with TAs. The theory assignments usually took about 3-5 hours and the programming assignments took roughly 7-12 hours if you did all the extra credit and GUI stuff (I have no idea why a course on data structures makes you to waste time on Java GUIs). Grading was lenient, with plenty of bonus points and extra credit. Most of the HW was graded very late towards the end of the semester, so you really didn't know how you were doing till then. He also doesn't release HW solutions, so that might be a problem if you don't get 100s on the HWs (which isn't hard to do).\r\n\r\nThe midterm was straight-forward and grading was ridiculously generous. He even gave people partial credit for totally wrong answers. The average was a 76 on 83. The final was open book and much, much harder, though grading was still stupidly lenient. He told us the test was non-cumulative, but it was actually cumulative. It didn't matter much since it was open book, but still... Also, pay attention to special data structures he mentions in class since they all showed up on the final.\r\n\r\nThis class is as easy A+ if you're reasonably smart and do the extra credit. You will learn what you need to know and you can always supplement your learning through the textbook which is pretty good. The hard part is dealing with Shlomo's totally disorganized attitude towards the class. I postponed data structures to sophomore year because I was trying to avoid Shlomo, but ended up taking him anyway. It wasn't all bad, so don't worry too much.",

If you've read all these reviews and you think \"I'm a better, smarter wo/man than them -- I can do HONORS,\" well, I, too, once thought as you do. Learn from my mistakes, and stay away from this class.\r\n\r\nI'm taking this class with Professor Hershkop in spite of repeated and insistent advice from survivors not to take it (it can't be that bad!) and at present I can say without a shadow of a doubt that it's the worst class I've taken in 7 semesters of college-level study. Please note that I'm not saying this because I have a bad grade or some such thing -- I'm on track to get an A+.\r\n\r\nThere are three essential problems. \r\n\r\nFirst, Professor Hershkop is strikingly disorganized, and tries to disguise this with claims like \"Courseworks isn't working,\" when a normal grown-up would take responsibility and apologize and have his act together the next time around. (The previous reviewer from a year ago mentioned the same excuse, which is why I'm confident that this is NOT an actual technological difficulty.) He also forgets what he's already taught us, and winds up reteaching it, or fails to teach something entirely (e.g. search algorithms) but then assesses it on the homework.\r\n\r\nSecond, Professor Hershkop's definitions of terms are frequently at odds with those used by... everyone else. For example, his definition of \"tail recursion\" is the exact opposite of the one used by Wikipedia, job interviewers, and the world of computer science in general, which wouldn't be a such a big deal if it weren't for the fact that tail recursion is a popular technical point for interview questions. When questioned about this in class he does not own up to the error (in contrast with basically every other professor -- Jae Lee, for one, is almost excited when students catch him out) and instead acts as if this is a major point of disagreement in the CS community, and then proceeds to continue using and testing us on the wrong definition. In case you think this is an isolated incident, he uses B-Tree and B+-Tree interchangeably -- you can check for yourself that these are completely different data structures.\r\n\r\nThird, the homework and test questions are typically ambiguous at a number of different levels. They often do not specify critical features of a data structure (is a given heap a min or a max heap?), which of multiple conflicting definitions of a term should be used (quadratic probing can be done any number of ways), or whether we should use his definition of a term or the normal one (in the cases of tail recursion and B-Trees), and they can even have grammatical ambiguities that make a crucial difference to interpretation. He tries to mask this by not giving assignments back, not offering comments, not providing solutions, and not providing definitive answers as to which of multiple interpretations of a question is correct.\r\n\r\nOh, and he also never responds to email, despite insisting that he'll respond promptly.",

The reason he races through topics was not because he had so much to cover, but rather because he missed six lectures during the first month for religious holidays, and five of them were simply canceled despite his promise to make them up.  The remaining lecture was covered by an undergraduate TA.\r\n\r\n\t2.\tThere are no published solutions to the assignments, neither for the benefit of the TAs or the students, and this hurts both of us.  If the TA misinterprets a question, the people who interpret it correctly get punished.  Because the assginments are often poorly and ambiguously worded, the probability of misinterpretation is high.  Furthermore, comments are rarely provided on the homework, so if you want to know where you went wrong, it's your job to email the TAs/professor.\r\n\r\n\t3.\tThe grading was ridiculously slow.  Before final exams, it took a minimum of a month to receive grades for any given assignment.  This wasn't because they were busy writing extensive feedback, as almost no feedback was provided whatsoever.  After the final, all of our assignments were magically graded within two weeks, which means that the TAs/professor weren't incapable of grading in a reasonable time fashion, but they just chose not to.\r\n\r\n\t4.\tNothing administrative that the instructor says is ever true, and by that I mean that everything is subject to change.  When he says that \"homework X/practice exam Y will be posted tonight\", that probably won't happen, and sometimes there's a lag of as much as two weeks (Sidenote: he likes blaming Courseworks when he claims he posts something but it never actually gets posted.  I find it funny that a professor in CS is my only professor to date to have these types of difficulties with Courseworks).  When he says that the exam is closed-book/closed-notes/in-class, he may very well change his mind at the last minute.  Sometimes you will receive notice that he changed his mind, and other times you will not.  \r\n\r\n\t5.\tWhile discrete math was listed as a corequisite, there wasn't a single mention of this in the class, and absolutely none of the material from discrete math was used.  Proofs by induction and recurrence relations might have been useful to learn (and are usually used in this class), but he decided not to mention them at all.\r\n\r\n\t6.\tPeople do not write bad reviews of Professor Hershkop because he is a hard grader.  To the contrary, the semester-end grading was incredibly generous.  People hate his classes because they are insults to people who are making an active effort to learn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n",

You may take this knowledge into consideration as my opinion gets away from me...\r\n\r\nFull disclosure I have not completed the course but am one month away from completing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hershkop's class is a disaster.  He seems to take no responsibility ensuring that the material of the course is covered.  His assignments are riddled with errors.  These errors cause so much confusion that it is likely you will end up answering a question in 4 different ways just to be sure that you covered all the bases of his ambigously phrased question.\r\n\r\nHe missed several classes and did not make up them.  He frequently started class 5-10 minutes earlier than the scheduled time.  Occasionally he would end class early.\r\n\r\nHe consistently rushes through material.  What should be covered in 2 or 3 lectures he will literally cover in 10 minutes.  He must think that covering a topic is announcing a chapter title.  He has the absolutely infuriating habit of asking \"if there are any questions\" after every 2 minutes in class.  This may seem like he's open to questions but I really think he is just killing time because he realizes he actual hasn't taught any material and is hoping that someone will ask a question that gives him the opportunity to teach something.  Unfortunately it is my experience that fellow students are hungry for learning and don't know where to start asking questions because they have no base of understanding from which to start.\r\n\r\nBesides if you do offer a cogent answer to one of his questions don't bother.  He always rigs the question after you've answered it.  Like it's a game to show that he's the teacher.  When asking a question there is one obvious answer but he changes the terms of the questions after answer it thereby making your answer wrong.  Or his question was too ambigous to answer in the first place.\r\n\r\nHis programming assignments have an obscene lack of focus.  I spent 90% of my time working on object oriented design, file system apis, java language principals, java GUI apis and spend 10% of my time implementing the data structures and algorithms.  His assignments do a poor job of reinforcing the material meant to be covered in class.  The same lack of detail and error exists in his programming assignment.\r\n\r\nHis TA's informed us that it was not a policy of the class to reveal the average (or standard deviation, etc) of the grades of any assignment returned or the midterm.  I have no idea why this could be.  I can only speculate that the grades were disastrous because his teaching is disastrous and he's covering it up.  The grading process in general was a complete black box.  Assignments are never handed back with comments.  You're lucky if on courseworks there is a few comments (at most a sentence) as to what you got wrong.  You'll need to write the TA or Professor for that information.\r\n\r\nThis is the best Columbia can offer?  The professor should be fired.  \r\n",

Some (actually most) would say there really is no teaching being done, and going to class is just to find out what things you have to go on the internet/break open the books to learn yourself. This is completely true. Be prepared to scour the interwebs for tutorials and the sort if you are as unfamiliar to PERL and C as I was. \r\n\r\nOn to the class...\r\n\r\nThe class... was really what you made of it. I usually went to lecture because it was closer than my dorm from the class I had right before it. They were ok and I'm sure if I was the diligent notetaking type I would have gotten a little more out of the class than i did. But be prepared to get sidetracked, because like every lecture, there will be dumb questions being asked (once, some kid asked a question where the answer was literally on the slide we were on). Normally this isn't a big deal, but Shlomo has a tendency to stop and continue on that tangent. I think we've finished 3 lectures without him putting on a flipbook presentation of the last 20 slides in the 3 mins at the end of class. \r\n\r\nThe lab (not the assignments) was surprisingly enjoyable. I did spend much of my time there laughing and fumbling with the assignments, but having people there who ostensibly were there to help you was a tiny bit calming. Unfortunately, if you actually NEED help, then good luck. I'm sure the TAs are very capable programmers, but like most people who can do, they really can't teach. Take this with a grain of salt, as each year the TAs change. Shlomo, while he is there for maybe the first half of the term, goes AWOL when shit gets real in C.\r\n\r\nThe one awesome thing that I particularly enjoyed about Shlomo (no sarcasm) is that he is super lenient with deadlines.

For example, he promised for weeks on end to set up virtual servers for the group projects. In the end, he never did (nor did he tell the class that he had changed his mind, so some students were left hanging). Since we had no virtual servers, the only way for us to collaborate on the projects was for one partner to give the other his password(!). \r\n\r\nWorse, the projects are built to encourage horrible programming practices. He doesn't just allow them - he encourages and sometimes requires them. For example: we store our data in flat text files, rather than databases. For example: \r\n\r\n1. We were not allowed to use 'make install' to install external modules; we had to move the files into place manually. \r\n2. We were not allowed to use MOOSE to do object-oriented programming in Perl (because he 'didn't want to have to learn MOOSE'). Forget that nowadays all Perl object-oriented programming uses MOOSE.\r\n3. For example: we were told to use C/C++ to implement CGI scripts (which are themselves outdated), instead of using Perl, which we had already learned. C is the only language that doesn't support strings natively, so why would string manipulation be our first introduction to C, as well as our only major project in C?\r\n4. We were essentially prevented from using version control for the group project, as well as the individual assignments.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the syllabus was last revised in 1995. There is no reason to be teaching Perl anymore - and if it should be taught, we shouldn't be spending more than half the semester on it (as we did). If CGI scripts are believed relevant (which they really aren't), then they shouldn't be written in C. Webthumb is a script that nobody has used outside the Columbia CS curriculum since 1997. This is supposed to be the class where you learn about important tools like version control, shell scripting, and the like. In Hershkop's class, you'll learn none of these. \r\n\r\nGrading is slow to the point of providing no useful feedback whatsoever. By the time you get each lab back, you'll have turned in three more. I'll be surprised if we get the grades for the midterm project before we take the final (which looks unlikely at this point).\r\n\r\nIn short, there was nothing redeeming about this class. Prof. Hershkop takes an imperfect syllabus and manages to make it even worse. It's clear that he doesn't put much thought into the class - most of the time on the assignments is spent trying to debug the typos in his sample code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDijkstra once said, 'The teaching of BASIC should be rated as a criminal offence: it mutilates the mind beyond recovery'. But if you ever have the chance to learn BASIC as an alternative to taking this class, by all means, go for it. It'll damage your programming career less than Hershkop's class would.",

I put almost exactly these notes in the little box on Courseworks, and I fervently pray that somebody in the department reads them.\r\n\r\nI feel bad for Prof. Hershkop. I really do. The way this course is designed -- or, at least, the way he seems to envision it -- it's impossible for an ordinary mortal to teach (Jae Lee, I'm told by his rapturous former students, is made of a different stuff than the rest of us, but that's a discussion for another day). 3157 requires its instructors to have an intimate knowledge of C, C++, make, Perl, Ruby, HTML, CSS, HTTP, CGI, memory, security, obscurity, etc. Not an impossible list of things to learn, but for somebody whose real work only deals with two or three of them, perhaps a bit unreasonable.\r\n\r\nDear Shlomo, unfortunately, isn't up to the task. His knowledge of web standards seems to end in about 1998 (he suggested that a problem with one of my labs, ultimately traced to bad server configuration, was because I wrote my newlines as &lt;br /&gt; rather than &lt;br&gt;). Ditto stylesheets. As for the unfortunate Ruby / RoR lecture, he was forced to resort to a mortifying game of \"spot-the-error\" with the class to cover up for the fact that he was completely clueless about variable scope in Rails controllers. Not everything was wasted -- I feel like I have a pretty solid knowledge of Perl, and the course was a useful C / C++ refresher for me.\r\n\r\nBut my real problem is this: He loves webapps, but in an effort to come up with \"applications\" for the things we learn in class, Prof. Hershkop assigns projects that actively encourage VERY BAD DESIGN PRACTICES.\r\n\r\nFor example: In order to avoid adding a brief intro to relational databases to the already-groaning syllabus, students are encouraged to do everything with flat file databases. Nobody even mentions the fact that this is fundamentally unscalable.\r\n\r\nFor example: The entire second project required us to write vast numbers of CGI scripts in C++. Hardly anybody uses CGI anymore, and they sure as hell don't write the scripts in C++ when they do.\r\n\r\nFor example: Some of the labs instructed us to write Makefile jobs not to compile our code, but to run it.\r\n\r\nFor example: we were forced to repeatedly work with a nasty little script called webthumb. At this very moment, there are a hundred copies of Firefox running in a hundred X server sessions spawned by a hundred instances of webthumb because some poor sod never found all the bugs in his copy of webthumb. There are many better ways to do this, but apparently part of being an Advanced Programmer is remaining wedded to long-dead technologies, even when superior alternatives exist.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I hope my point is clear. I think there is a place for this class within the CS major, but it needs to be slimmed down, modernized and a little less webapp-happy.",

He gives homework extensions to anyone who asks for them and for almost any reason. If you need more time, you have it (but this is also a con, see below).\r\n3. Pretty easy\r\n.... that's about it.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n1. Extensions that *everyone* abuses. I'm ok with giving homework extensions if people are sick, but I had friends who purposely abused the system and took advantage of him, which is unfair to people like me who did homework on time. It's quite ridiculous when people turn in homework a month late with no penalty.\r\n2. Typos. He can't even add. The points on the homework never add up and his slides are full of errors.\r\n3. Boring! He teaches from slides and doesn't engage students well. I fall asleep (it was a 9 am class though)\r\n4. Useless homework. Most assignments are pointless and not useful. You won't get much out of the course, except learning how to debug webthumb. What's that you say? Exactly - pointless! Those who took the class know what I'm talking about. \r\n5. Lack of communication. He doesn't communicate with students well, and I heard that he never really speaks to the TAs, who grade the homework, so they are a bit confused and grading is sometimes inconsistent.\r\n6. Perl - pointless\r\n7. Almost every assignment is a CGI program -- never useful outside of this class\r\n\r\nOverall, he's just a mess. It doesn't seem like he puts much time into teaching. You'll probably do fairly well in the course (at least B+), but you won't get anything out of it. Avoid this prof and take it with Jae, who is actually useful and on top of his shit.

For each set, 10 hours seems like a reasonable average estimate, though it\u2019s best to space them out to give yourself time to digest the material and develop ideas.\n\nThat said, I must note my only complaint about the course: the grading of the problem sets, done entirely by the TAs, often felt arbitrary and careless, and consequently, unhelpful. There was no clear grading rubric provided in advance, resulting in inconsistent assessments. Detailed solutions were sometimes penalized for being too \u201cverbose,\u201d while concise ones lost points for omitting a single line of middle-school-level algebra.\n\nMoreover, it often seemed that the TAs skimmed submissions and occasionally dismissed valid alternative approaches simply because they differed from the official solution. Some deductions were made without any comment, rubric, or explanation, which was both confusing and unhelpful. While regrade requests were available in theory, in practice they were largely ineffective: many were denied with explanations that either misrepresented my solution or offered unreasonable justifications--for instance, rejecting logically equivalent (and arguably more precise) answers that did not match the question\u2019s wording exactly.\n\nSince we do not know which problems were graded by which TAs, it is probable that this issue stems from only one grader and could be dismissed as an isolated case, especially since every TA I\u2019ve personally spoken with has been patient and helpful to the greatest possible extent. I am in a position where my grade in this course does not matter and simply find this entertainingly absurd, much like a heated Reddit argument; however, those for whom it does may find the grading process confusing, discouraging, and ultimately frustrating, as 100% of the coursework--both problem sets and exams--is graded by TAs."

He made a difficult subject accessible and interesting.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you hate proofs and theory, maybe this class is not for you, but this is not his fault. He already tried his best to focus on the concept rather than the details.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think that the class has no applications. It\u2019s basically an algorithm class, but on algorithms that can learn. If you think algorithms have no real world application, then I am not sure what to say.  It\u2019s cool to see that a seemingly simple-minded algorithm can learn complex concepts well, on par with humans (maybe it is how human brains work).\r\n\r\nThe homework takes a long time, so start early so that you have enough time to get help. He won\u2019t tell you the solution directly, but at least can tell you if you are on the right track. A lot of times, people are just completely off the track because they have misconceptions. For me, I think part of the homework difficulty comes from my unfamiliarity with the area, so the 3rd and 4th homeworks turned out more difficult for me, but by the end of the last (5th) homework, I had already seen enough proof strategies that they became a bit like old tricks  (I\u2019m not saying they are easy, but just more familiar to me).\r\n\r\nAs a previous post said, the final project turned out to be an educational experience for me. But I guess it depends on what paper you choose. I chose something closely related to what we learned and also not too ambitious, and it turned out to be a good choice.  I am glad that I was able to understand at least some parts of an original research paper in the field, which depends your understanding of class material but also adds onto that.\r\n\r\nAbout latex, I have mixed feelings. It\u2019s really a pain to type in latex. I feel I spent close to half of my homework time on typing up in latex. But I understand that it makes things easier for TAs, who already have a lot of work. Also, some other classes (e.g ML) may require latex.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I learned a lot without too much stress. (the homeworks can be stressful/frustrating , but overall, the amount learned/stress ratio is much higher than an average CS class at Columbia).",

The book for most of the semester (Kearns and Vazirani) is ok, at least it's nice and concise. \r\n\r\nIn lectures Servedio was generally clear, but I found that his answers to questions were only so-so. I think part of it is that the class was huge this semester, and it seemed like he wasn't scaling well from 30 students to 100, but maybe that will improve.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets kicked my ass, I rarely got more than a few points above the average, which was typically 20-30 out of 50 points. They require a huge amount of thought, and almost all required some novel proof technique. Some questions were from research papers from only 5 or 10 years ago, many were papers Servedio wrote 10-20 years ago.

Of all the times I went to speak with him he was never short with me and was always genuinely interested in helping me learn the material. The man has a clear and present passion about what he teaches to the point where he seemed like he didn't want to hold back in his explanations (and thus divulge too much information about a particular problem I was having issues with). At one point he offered to meet with me since I wasn't going to be able to make his office hours that Friday. I can't imagine any of my other professors at Columbia doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nHis teaching is impeccable; no lazy PowerPoint slides here. I've always appreciated the teachers who give explanations to the class as they write; this level of engagement has always made learning feel much more natural and Dr. Servedio is very gifted at doing this. Every class he writes the notes and explains them at the same time and in general the process is paced very well and feels incredibly engaging.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, this class is HARD. Unless you have a passion for theory and machine learning, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is not for those with a superficial interest in either of those areas. I took this class because I had a passing interest in both fields and I had heard good things from classmates who had previously taken his class. I needed a class to fill out the rest of my semester and so I chose to take it; I chose wrong. The above words are not meant to be taken lightly; if you are not grounded in theory or lack the passion for this material, I assure you in the utmost that this class is not for you.\r\n\r\nThis class was meant to be my crash course in CS theory and I had not had much exposure to it outside of discrete math from my undergraduate school. I was also taking Algorithms at the same time. If there was ever a class that needed a pre-requisite, CLT might take the cake; some background in theory and notation would have, I believe, made worlds of difference for me. Rocco does have materials on his website that are meant to help you brush up on the basics needed for this class but the preparation seemed to fall very short of where I needed to be to do the assignments (more below).",

                "workload": "The workload for this class does not seem intimidating at first. You have five homework assignments, a final paper, and he now gives a final exam. Each homework assignment is only 5 problems. Do not take that number lightly; these assignments will break you. Expect to spend very considerable time doing each one; the problems are not only extremely challenging but you have to do everything in Latex. I made the mistake of taking CLT during a semester where my workload was very severe; do not make this mistake or you will be burned.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are by far the hardest I have ever done in my life. Every once in a while there would be a problem I could solve completely but most of the time I felt like I was taking shots in the dark. We're talking problems that demand an utmost intimacy with the material; there are no problems even remotely close to a freebie here. You will spend hours upon hours gazing at your notes, just trying to make sense of everything, and even longer trying to make sense of the material in the context of the problem you are solving. Furthermore, partial credit is difficult to obtain at best; unless your solution is meticulously detailed and bulletproof, you WILL lose a lot of points. The average on every assignment as such was always absurdly low; I think only two of them were higher than 25/50 (all homeworks are out of 50 points, 10 points per problem)\r\n\r\nAs good as Rocco is at teaching, I did not find that the lectures really prepared me for the problem sets; that is why I think a decent background/passion in CS theory is necessary for this class. Virtually every problem demands some degree of intuition which isn't easy to obtain without the right background and only comes with experience. Taking this class in the context that I did oftentimes felt like being a fish out of water. I will reiterate: only take this if you have a decent CS theory background and/or a passion for the material.\r\n\r\nThe final exam wasn't too hard. Just about every problem was an identification question testing whether or not you paid attention in class. They were largely some variation on \"What were we talking about when we discussed ______?\". The last problem could have easily been on the problem sets which, given the time we had (1.5 hours; the exam was the last day of class), wasn't attempted by many.\r\n\r\nThe paper assignment was enjoyable and is supposed to be an opportunity to learn more about an area of computational learning theory that wasn't covered in class. I thought it was a smart move on Dr. Servedio's part to assign this in order to give students some freedom in exploring areas of interest. The stipulations of the paper were fairly light; all we were really required to do was to read a paper on some topic of computational learning theory, summarize the main ideas, and ultimately convince Dr. Servedio that we understood what we read."

As other reviewers have already pointed out, Prof. Servedio gives the clearest, best-organized lectures in the department---he made a large body of complicated theory totally intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe format of the class is nice: no exams, just a few problem sets and a final project. His argument is that the insight necessary to solve most of the problems in this class doesn't come right away even if you have a solid understanding of the material, so a test isn't a fair evaluation. This was certainly my experience---I felt like I had a better grasp of the theory than most of the class (this is judging by the pset averages: as so often seems to happen in this department, the undergrads inevitably outperform the grad students) and I would regularly spend hours staring at the homework assignments without making any progress.\r\n\r\nProf. Servedio was also extremely available outside of class, and was extremely helpful in suggesting references and proof techniques for my final project.\r\n\r\nSome advice: as soon as every problem set comes out, take an hour or so to just think about the problems without any expectation of solving them. Your brain has this marvelous ability to process subconsciously, and you'll find that if you return to the pset in a few days you've already made a great deal of progress without reading this.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you're in either the theory track or the AI track, this is a fun, low-stress (but not low-workload!) class that will do wonders for your development as as a computer scientist.",

                "content": "Prof. Servedio's very good, gifted even, at explaining section a.b.c through to x.y.z of the textbook. His lectures, notes, and problem sets are high quality, better than those found elsewhere on course websites at CMU or UT Austin. So you will learn something or even a lot but is the right thing and is it worth taking for credit? No.\r\n\r\nDO NOT think that taking his learning theory course is of help in machine learning or data mining courses. I did well on the latter without needing or being able to use ANY of what I learnt here.\r\nHis style is lemma, proof, lemma, proof and a large fraction of the time is spent on proof minutae at the cost of developing re-usable big picture ideas or connections to topics in machine learning. This fatal flaw in his presentation also results in a poor breadth of topics covered.\r\nOnce I asked Prof. Jebara a question and he replied \"That comes from the PAC model\" or such. Imagine your frustration at spending a 20 hr/week semester learning the PAC model in this course but not being able to relate it or apply your knowledge. Do not think that you can get help at that point because the standard response is \"take Prof. Servedio's course\".\r\n\r\nIt's my belief that he's on a personal crusade against grade inflation and tries to actively deflate your grade:\r\n1) The solutions to the assignments are deliberately written poorly. You'll soon give up on trying to learn where you went wrong and may miss key \"tricks\" or key conceptual points in solving problems in general. This is quite devious because a lot of important course material is left to the assignments to develop and it's hard to improve your problem solving ability on future assignments. The only reason I can think of why anyone would do this is to prevent copying/selling of materials. The course staff should consider having a 30 minute recitation to go over the solutions if they are paranoid (or you should ask during office hours).\r\n2) There is no feedback on average/median/max/min and marks distribution for any assignment. Make SURE you specifically ask for this to judge your progress and calibrate your effort. It's easy to get blindsided and find out that there are 10 students who have scored near perfect on every assignment or 70% of the class has the same average.\r\n3) He takes the view proofs are either completely right or wrong, the latter gets you a 0 with unpredictable partial credit. Nothing infuriates you like a 0 on something you spent 6 hours crafting because you missed a minor detail. It feels like a penalty on attempting to solve the problem. Expect this to happen a lot and do not underestimate the effect on your motivation.\r\n4) The grading system is ill-conditioned (e.g. 84-86 = A, 79.5-83.99 = A-,..) therefore I feel that your grade precariously hangs on his impression of you.\r\n\r\nBased on the above I would have serious doubts about taking another one of Prof. Servedio's courses for credit. Definitely do not take his learning theory course if you're not a Phd student in theory. If you're aiming to become one I suggest you take a computational complexity course or algorithms/optimization/math courses as this course will not help you in the future.",

                "content": "This class is billed as \"practical methods in linear algebra for computer science\". It is, without question, the least practical course I have ever taken.\r\n\r\nWe've all taken Calc III, so we've all seen a class without content before (and let's be honest -- unless you plan to pursue a graduate degree in vision or graphics, all the linear algebra you need for a CS degree fits on the front and back of a sheet of paper). So Prof. Wozniakowski does what any reasonable theoretical mathematician would do, and turns this into a class about theory instead.\r\n\r\nThis is not the problem. The problem is that his \"theoretical\" approach to linear algebra essentially consists of stumbling into class, drawing an arbitrary matrix on the board, and proving its special properties. Do not expect any discussion of the usefulness, significance or relationship of any of the topics you cover. Everything turns out to have very important practical implications, but Wozniakowski will not teach you about them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you also wind up without the tools to do theory yourself. So when his exams ask you to prove new, different things about special matrices, you, and the rest of the class, will fail. The average on the midterm was below 50%.\r\n\r\nYou will come out of this class knowing more things than you ever cared to know about Householder matrices and eigenvalues and the infinity norm and the spectral radius, but you will be able to do exactly nothing with that knowledge.\r\n\r\nAdvice:\r\n\r\n-- Don't buy the book. Gilbert Strang's canonical linear algebra textbook is generally not very good, and it is absolutely useless for this course (every time you go to look up something we discussed in class, Strang simply says \"we won't bother proving this right now\"). One of my classmates remarked that his still has that new-textbook smell because he hasn't opened it.\r\n\r\n-- The TAs were atrocious. Whoever it is next semester, make sure to interrogate them about every homework assignment (this will entail 10 visits to office hours) or your grade will suffer. Over the course of the semester, I was deducted points for such offenses as writing my answer in the middle of the page where the TA couldn't see it, providing a python script that ran normally under CUNIX but not with the TA's fucked-up $PATH, and having the same first name as another student in the class. Be vigilant.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I don't feel like my time was completely wasted, simply because the material we're actually supposed to cover doesn't merit its own class. I feel like things make more sense now that I'm connecting the dots on my own (protip: your enjoyment will be greatly increased if you wiki every word that comes out of his mouth), but I can think of many less painful ways of learning this material, and in the end I'm not sure I really needed it in the first place.",

                "content": "This course was wack. Despite the class having 85 students, Prof. Belhumeur insisted that it was supposed to be a seminar. Every week, the prof picked a topic, and 4 students had to volunteer to present papers that were related to said topic. Since the class was 2 hours long, each student was originally supposed to present 2 papers in 15-20 minutes. However, the presentations always went on too long, causing a huge backlog early on that we never recovered from. As a result, we never got to the second half of the topics, and some students were never able to present.\n\nThis brings me to my main complaint about the class: Prof. Belhumeur doesn't do anything. He mostly sits back and expects students to run the class for him. This would be understandable for a traditional seminar, but it's just not feasible for every student to be able to present when the professor isn't even moderating the presentation times appropriately. You'd think that this wouldn't be a big deal, but this became a serious issue when final letter grades came out (more on that later). It doesn't help that he's notorious for ignoring emails and Slack messages, so most communication is with the TAs instead.\n\nIn addition to student presentations, there was also a semester long project to be done in groups of 1-4. Based on my experience, the grading for these projects was also ridiculously inflated like it was in Prof. Belhumeur's Deep Learning for Computer Vision class, which is why the final letter grades ended up being so surprising for a good portion of students.\n\nTake this course if you can commit to presenting in class early on so you don't run the risk of losing your chance to present. The project is open-ended and flexible on purpose, and you're guaranteed a good grade on it as long as you demonstrate some degree of effort.",

If you're not presenting, you'll have to read all the papers that will be presented that week and write a short paragraph summary for each one. You can totally wing these summaries since the TAs only check for completion as part of your attendance grade. The final project can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Some people fine tune a couple pre-trained PyTorch models on a commonly used dataset and call it a day. Others slave away for about 100 hours over the course of the term if they're serious about publishing their project in a conference.\n\nNow about the grading: unlike most classes, Prof. Belhumeur never announced how much each component was weighted when calculating final letter grades. Based on my conversation with the head TA, I earned 95/100 on the final project and 10/10 on the summary sheets for attendance. However, I ended up with only an A- because I never presented any papers or my final project, and I also never signed up for a presentation slot either. Obviously not everyone could present due to the time constraints and the large class size, but my understanding is that I would've gotten an A if I signed up for a presentation slot even if I wasn't able to actually present. This lack of transparency is frustrating, and it's compounded by the fact that getting in touch with the professor outside of class was unnecessarily challenging. On the other hand, the head TA always responded to me within seconds, but it was unfortunate that even he and the other TAs weren't informed about how letter grades were assigned."

There is no critique on programming style and you're expected to learn MATLAB (3 hrs) on your own. The code that you write, including the final project, are toy programs averaging 80 lines of code. The algorithm itself is only 10-20 lines of API calls, the rest is I/O.\r\n3) No theory behind Image processing is covered, basic API calls are provided in the skeleton code for the assignment. PCA and Fisher analysis is discussed but this is 3 lectures at most.\r\n4) DO NOT take this course for Machine Learning.

He's approachable, and buys drinks for students during exams!\nOh, one more thing...

You don't need any books since the slides have all the formulas, derivations, and examples you need to do homework. (I wish we could get electronic copies of the slides, since it's in a computer **vision** class, sometimes you need to see the colors in a diagram/picture for things to make sense.

He likes discipline, mind you, but is not that fanatic about it.\r\n\r\nYou cannot miss any of his lectures as the slides will stare at you when you prepare for the midterm or final. You get printed slides so you just need to take down additional notes (if any).  In Spring 2014, he tried a lot of new material and so the overall workload increased exponentially after midterm. He also took feedback post midterm and in the last class to update the class materials. There were review classes in the lecture before the tests which were quite helpful, if at all you started preparing!\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a study group as making sense of each slide takes up a lot of time although everything seems like a breeze during the class. TA's were very helpful. Thomas was a little picky in giving points but used to explain important concepts easily. You won't understand where exactly you lost points but they do indicate the relevant challenge number. Though programming in MATLAB seems easy, debugging is a headache. Make sure you proceed step by step. Just a tip: avoid built in functions unless you are completely sure of what they return. Getting a working solution was not enough to secure full points. You need to provide a 'smart' solution.\r\n\r\nI was taking Computer Graphics along with it and I must say a lot of my fundamentals got cleared through this class. His 'Math Primer' slides were just mind-boggling. Everything was explained in such an elegant manner. Overall, \"you get a lot for the tuition you pay\" in Prof. Nayar's words!",

Great lecturing style, clearly super intelligent, and genuinely does his best to make sure we understand the material. That said, we cover a lot of material in this class, and preparing for the exams is hellish. The exams generally cover some of the easier concepts in the class, but it's also easy to lose points on proofs and there are also quite a few questions where you just have to remember a specific detail or some model which you otherwise can't derive on the spot. No way around some of this stuff unless you put a lot of time into memorization of the material.\r\n\r\nHomeworks are great! They're done in MATLAB now (I think he said they were in C until a couple years ago), so they're constantly evolving - Nayar admits as much himself, especially that he put a lot more material in the class and on the HWs this semester. This is not a class you want to procrastinate on (nor can you afford to). If you start the night before, you may stay up all night, and just not be able to finish due to the difficulty of some of these homeworks. You should start at least a few days before so you have time to consult the TAs because you will inevitably run into MATLAB bugs, amongst other issues with understanding the Vision algorithms themselves.\r\n\r\nYou should probably attend every class because Professor Nayar doesn't post any of the material on courseworks. The TAs print out all the lecture slides and you pick up one of these packets at the beginning of each class. These are literally just printouts of the slides, so you'll want to take miscellaneous notes and comments based on what the professor says while presenting each slide.\r\n\r\nWe didn't receive any information about the distribution of grades this semester, so I can only comment that my grade was definitely lower than expected. A few people have said the same thing about their grades, but we can't make any generalizations. Just know it's a hard class - if you get a low grade, don't worry too much about it because this is one of the best, most useful classes you'll take in the CS@CU department, from one of the best professors around.",

Aho is not a very engaging lecturer \u2013 he talks very slowly in a monotone voice. He also fails to go over very many examples for a lot of the theorems, because they are common sense to him (he is a very Smart Man). I do, however, believe that you can learn to learn from Aho \u2013 at the beginning of the semester I felt lost at every lecture, but towards the middle and end I realized that if I attended class and wrote down everything he said, then went over it later for ~30 minutes with the online lecture notes, I could definitely understand the material.\r\n\r\nNote: apparently Aho is also the only one who teaches lambda calculus (other than Verma, who is new). Although the subject itself is easy, it is also useless plus it means the rest of the semester is rushed so that he can fit in lambda calculus.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would say it is a good course taught by a good professor.

                "content": "Very underwhelming class. I chose to take CS Theory with Aho due to his fame...in hindsight, this was a bad decision for me. I'm sure there are other people who feel differently, but this was my experience:\r\n\r\nLectures- Aho seems to think that the material is a lot easier than it actually is, often failing to adequately explain simpler concepts in favor of complex proofs, etc. that never appeared on homeworks or exams. This is probably due to the fact that he pretty much invented a lot of it; however, for most of us, this was our first experience with theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nAho also just plainly isn't an engaging lecturer. Listening to him lecture is a lot like listening to your great-uncle drone on about the Great Buckwheat Shortage of '68 (if your great-uncle is a great storyteller, then ignore this). Occasionally, Aho will talk about having dinner with Stephen Wolfram or working with Kernighan and Ritchie at Bell Labs, which is always cool but doesn't necessarily make the class worth taking.\r\n\r\nHomeworks- hard, but doable. There were five problems per problem set. They were problems that you had to do out and solve, which turned out to be useless because:\r\n\r\nExams- both the midterm and final were 10 true/false questions (with brief explanation). I just don't understand how ten true/false questions can adequately assess your knowledge of CS Theory. For the midterm, I studied all the algorithms and the workings of automata, but I did poorly on the exam (far below average). Many of the T/F questions were tricky (average was a 45, std. dev. of 22).\r\n\r\nFor the final, I didn't bother to learn how to solve any problems or do any proofs, because I knew they weren't going to be on the exam. Didn't really know much about Turing Machines. Bad mindset, I know, but I just studied the general concepts and did much better than the class average (which was a 75).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion- my recommendation? Take this class with someone else. I was not impressed...I'm not trying to be disrespectful towards Aho, but he is a professor that should be known for his accomplishments, not his teaching ability. Apparently he got a Great Teacher Award from Columbia at some point, but I feel like that has a lot to do with his legacy. I dunno, someone might come along and say something different, but I found the class dull and uninspirational.",

Luckily, his class notes (posted on his website) are a very condensed, very readable summary. They don't cover everything, though, so you'll have to fill the rest in yourself.\r\n\r\nAho is a very clear and straightforward lecturer. No matter what question you ask, he's able to answer it without hardly having to stop to think - almost robotic (in a good way). Few mistakes, doesn't skip a beat. And a good sense of humor to boot.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were straightforward - the problems were difficult, but short (either you knew the answer and could justify it, or you couldn't). No need to memorize tons of proof details when studying, as long as you understood the process and the underlying concepts. Be warned, though, there was at least one trick(y) question on each exam, so you really need to know the material well!\r\n\r\nI'm glad I took this class, as it gave me an appreciation for theoretical computer science (particularly lambda calculus) that I never had. It wasn't the most back-breaking CS class I've taken, but it's definitely one that you'll want to dedicate some time to, partly because the material is dense and abstract, and partly because Aho is just an all-around awesome dude.",

If, like me, you enjoyed Gross's digressions, you'll probably also enjoy accounts of evenings spent (no joke) playing violin concertos with the author of \"The Art of Computer Programming.\"\r\n\r\nYou, like Aho, should care deeply about the material.

If all you want to do is write Java programs to fit a spec, you shouldn't have bothered with college: the whole point of studying computer science at an institution like this one is to learn how to answer questions like the ones Aho asks, and, you know, do something interesting with your life.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I had a blast; if you like oddball teachers and hard problems you will too.",

It's not that he isn't brilliant (he is... for heaven sake's he is the \"a\" is \"awk\"), it's just that he has trouble teaching to a class.\r\n\r\nNow for the good: His office hours are golden. I cannot stress this enough. If you go into his office hours not understanding something, you'll come out of it completely and utterly understanding the subject; end of story. He is TERRIFIC 1 on 1. The homeworks are incredibly hard, so I recommend checking in during his office hours to double-check your work (or ask for pointers -- no puns intended) before submitting.\r\n\r\nThe other: As I said, his homeworks are incredibly hard (think Discrete math, but far, far more difficult). One of the last problems he gave us included a proof that HE had made in 1993 or some such proving that the way that perl handled regular expression recognition was NP-complete (when he first proposed this... no one believed him until he proved it). There was no way I could have solved this problem without going to office hours. But moreover, with the possible exception of the aforementioned problem, his assignments, while hard, are pretty fun. I don't mean you'll think they are entertaining, but they are well structured, so they are informative, and if you end up understanding the problem, it really helps you get a comprehensive understanding of the material (which is great). He also gives out practice exams that are incredibly useful. Grading is decently quick and fair.\r\n\r\nThis class is required for CS majors, so you have to take it, but if you have an option of taking it with or without Aho, take it with.",

But, after the first three or four weeks, we were often told to just look in the book to learn about any new concept. In fact, each new idea that was introduced was concluded with the words \"go look in the book.\" He gives affectations to being devoted to his students, and I remember going to office hours several times to ask about topics that weren't being elucidated particularly well by the book. Each time, he forgot my name, and at the end of the (short) conversation, his helpful response was -- guess what? -- \"go look in the book.\" This was irresponsible teaching, and he's able to get away with it because he is tenured and famed within his field. His teaching style would improve vastly if he could only say \"go look in the book\" in other ways, like \"refer to the book for more details\" or \"the book contains much more information on this topic\" or even \"read the book and it will explain this concept better than I can ever explain to you during this lecture.\" I took this class in Spring 2004, and I'm sadly still bitter about this class. You will learn much from this course, but learning about compilers from this guy would be no better than, say, go looking in the book and reading about it on your own.",

Julia is a very sweet professor  (I wish she offered more classes), but I'd be lying if I said I attended more than 3 lectures in person. The only lecture necessary for doing (pretty much all) the homeworks was the one in which she gives a run-down on Praat, the software used for the course. That being said, the lectures are pretty interesting. The homeworks are super easy if you've done any kind of work using Python and know some supervised learning techniques (even if you don't I feel like this should be pretty easy to learn). You can get away with starting homeworks 2 days before submission, and you definitely don't need more than 4 days for a homework. It may take a while to read through the documentation of the software (it was a little difficult to understand how to use Praat with Python) and get an outline of what to do for the homework, but once you have that, it's pretty straightforward. You also might have some trouble figuring out how to handle huge amounts of data, and it might be time-consuming, but I really don't think it's a tough course at all. \nThe only time I've had a major problem is when I wasn't able to download some software used for the course and none of the TAs really seemed to have a solution since I was on a Windows OS (I think it's pretty simple for Mac users). There were some others in the class who managed to figure it out, but I wish they'd have some more TAs who have worked on Windows before. \nOverall a really great smooth-sailing class, and a break from the absolute hell some other classes put us through.  100% would recommend.

There are a handful of algorithms I'll hang on to---two months after the midterm I'm fairly confident I could write a Brill tagger or a CYK parser---but realistically, I'll never need to, and most of the material is not that specific. This class is not so much about learning to do NLP as it is about learning to understand what's already been done.\r\n\r\nProf. Hirschberg herself is very sweet---helpful and accessible outside of class. She also has a very soothing voice. This turned out to be a bit of a problem: I came every day, but to my great shame would start to doze off around the 45-minute mark almost half the time. I would love for her to read me bedtime stories, but the bottomless slide decks and repetitive nature of the material mean that the lectures are unstimulating to the point of peril.\r\n\r\nIf you're at all interested in NLP I'd certainly recommend that you take this class; if you're just trying to fill the AI track requirements you'll learn more impressive things in graphics.",

The lectures move at an easy but reasonable speed, and the professor takes the time to provide intuition for and break down all the math and algorithms (if the diagrams in the slides weren't already good enough). At the end of some classes, we even watched some funny old shorts that showcased whatever concept we learned that week and that led into a bit of the interesting history in graphics. There were plenty of resources available - all the TAs were super helpful in office hours and on Piazza too.\r\n\r\nThe class is also well-paced in that the amount of work is relatively light throughout the entire semester, though we still somehow went through a lot of content. We go through things like colour theory, lighting models, basic algorithms for geometry (ray-object collisions), and their application to ray-tracing and pipeline rendering, interspersed with some short review o graphics-related linear algebra. Once the basic rendering process is down, we also get into optimization through special data structures, and sampling methods. By the end, we will have made a few interactive animations in OpenGL and a full-featured ray tracer. Each assignment builds slightly on top of the previous--so you need to know be willing to organize and architect your code a little (though he goes over this too).\r\n\r\nI definitely felt giddy and proud of myself after reaching each milestone, as the images my program could generate looked more and more awesome and expressive.",

As we live in the age that artists and product designers utilize 3D software such as Rhino or Maya or ZBrush, to digitally model their products before actualization into tangible objects, or to model cartoon characters that would appear in animated films, this class provides a great introduction into the technical aspects of how these 3D softwares work or should work. We study the fundamentals down to the level of so-called NURBS curves and surfaces, geometry processing performed on triangle meshes, and subdivision surfaces -- each with extensive mathematical backgrounds that consider how these structures give artists and manufacturers computational advantages such as desired degree of smoothness no matter what shape of the curves/surfaces are formed. It is a really fun experience to learn how design softwares are actually made of, and we also had a guest speaker from the industry to discuss how he actually uses the software to design real-world products.\r\n\r\nSo the class covers mainly three parts: the fundamentals of B-Spline curves and surfaces (as well as NURBS and Rational form), geometry processing (in particular, mesh data structures and mesh simplification algorithms), and Subdivision surfaces (e.g., Catmull-Clark). Each topic has extensive assignments associated with it to help us see how things are implemented. Some are really challenging, but Prof. Reed would give us extensions if needed. So we always have time to refine our assignments as possible. I'd say I'm very proud of the code I have done for this class, since they never look like a mess compared to other classes that I sometimes rush things through just to make it work. It's so organized, and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the professor, he is probably one of the best professors I've had for Computer Science class, personality-wise. He really took time to answer individual emails and discussion threads. He modified his assignments plan as the semester went, so we were given more challenging works since we did well as a class on the first few assignments, which helped me to learn even more. He was very approachable during his office hours or after class. So in a sense, you never feel isolated or helpless in this class. The only caveat is that his lectures sometimes may be a bit dry, but bare with them, and you will go a long way.\r\n\r\nSo, even with a slight interest in computer graphics in general, I'd recommend you to come and take the class, and you will be amazed how much you learn and have fun at the end.",

The only use of a computer for this course is to type the weekly homework assignments, which are all essay questions. The course introduces you the various applications of IT to medicine, especially the hospital environment. Topics include electronic patient record systems, biomedical imaging, electronic order form, and disease classification standards. Each topic is covered by a different professor from Columbia's uptown campus; Shortliffe himself handles 5 lectures or so.\nThe material is quite interesting in a hands-on way--you get to see how the CS stuff you learn gets applied. As such, it often involves brief, simplifying revisits the traditional CS classes, e.g. Database and NLP and Computability. On the other hand, it also involves a lot of medical jargon unknown to CS students, which make up half the class. Although Shortliffe said that the course does not assume any prior exposure to medicine, the lecturers (again, med school profs) tend to forget that. But perhaps this is only fair, since the medicine people tend to find the CS stuff hard to grasp.\n\nThe class also touches upon social and political issues like privacy issues and Medicare, as well as the theory and history behind Biomedical Informatics as a distinct academic field. Overall, a palatable salad of things and a nice escape from programming.",

This is one of the best courses I have taken in Columbia.\r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown\u2019s class provides a very comprehensive overview of NLP. Topics include language models, neural networks, word embeddings, sentimental analysis, POS tagging, parsing, semantics, machine translation, summarization.\r\n\r\nThe class materials and the homework assignments are a very good combination of theory and coding. For theory, we learn parsing algorithms, read word embedding papers, study the math formula behind those frequently used neural networks. For practice, we implement our own model to do stance prediction, sentimental analysis and machine translation. Assignments often go beyond simple code implementation. Instead, most of the assignment focuses on analysis of the models that we built \u2013 analysis of model performance, error analysis on frequent mistakes made by the model, comparison of different methods and models. These analysis techniques turn out to be very useful in real-word applications, and really distinguish those who know NLP from those who only know how to use packages. \r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown is a very nice person who actually cares about every student that she teaches. She is the first professor that I\u2019ve met with in Columbia who does her best to really remember almost everyone\u2019s name in the classroom (it\u2019s a class of approximately 100 students!) She enjoys meeting with students during office hours, providing not only help for class materials/assignments but also invaluable discussions about students\u2019 future career development and general academic interest. \r\n\r\nProfessor McKeown also knows well about how to teach. She does her best to make the class to interesting to everyone. She is a professor who really does her best to make sure everyone is following and understanding her lectures. She highly values class participation and interaction between professor and students, but speaking up in class is not mandatory for students to get participation points. Fully recognizing that some students may be shy about asking questions or speaking up publicly in class, she uses poll everywhere instead in class to collect students\u2019 feedback and questions to see if anything is unclear to the students. \r\n\r\nThe course materials are very interesting in itself, and I\u2019m especially amazed by the guest lectures of the course. Professor McKeown invited some of her former students who are now working in the industry to give guest lectures. One lecture that is especially inspiring is on dialog systems, where we get to know how dialog systems such as Siri and Alexa are built. Guest lectures from distinguished industry pioneers give the students another perspective on NLP from the industry.\r\n\r\nThe professor also makes sure that the class materials are up-to-date. NLP is a fast-changing field with lots of new concepts and techniques invented each year. Besides the basic materials and concepts of NLP, she also provides a brief walkthrough of a few recent breakthroughs in the academia. For example, we read together in class papers on BERT (a really cool and useful tool that\u2019s very famous) and papers on biases (a really cool and influential topic that appeared in recent years). Students interested in going to the academia or industry get to know these state-of-the-art results and techniques, which bridge the gap between school and future career. \r\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend Professor Kathy McKeown\u2019s class to anyone interested in NLP or anyone interested in knowing more about computer science. The class materials are awesome. The professor is extremely amazing. You will learn a huge amount out of this class. ",

Other reviewers complain about the focus on 'boring algorithmic parts' and lack of attention to philosophical implications. This is both ironic and inaccurate on a number of counts. First, the early part of the course was dedicated to a thorough consideration of the difference between human-like and rational behavior; in addition, a number of readings were posted over the term that addressed just these issues. Second, this course is offered in a computer science department; the capacity of computer scientists to have impact on scientific or philosophical problems is founded in the algorithmic details. Glossing over this material would cheat serious students who are willing to do the work. I enjoyed the course and still discuss and apply the material I learned.",

Personally, I liked the speed at which the course was taught. It's also helpful that Rubenstein tends to spend the first 5 minutes of each lecture reviewing what he covered the class before and everything is recorded. Lectures aren't always the most entertaining, but then again there are only so many ways you can make things like MIPS or adders sound exciting. If you've ever wondered fundamentally how a processor works, you'll definitely find it at least somewhat interesting. \n\nRubenstein himself is a pretty good lecturer.

Lemme just say... no I'm not doing fine. As a CS major that is not interested in CE or EE, this class is going to be such a headache. The first homework sets will be doable since they deal with binary numbers and K-maps, but after that when you get into MUXs and further, you will struggle a lot on the homeworks. Rubenstein makes the homeworks very challenging, so the only way I'm turning in these PSets is by the help of the TAs explaining and helping me out with them during OH. The midterms and finals are 3 HOURS long and are tough. The curve for the midterm was higher than what I accepted because of the CE majors. Good thing, I didn't take this class seriously or personally and just did the bare minimum. I barely know anything in this class, and I'm cool with that. I'm never gonna use this class as a software engineer in the future. Rubenstein assigns tough problems, but I appreciate his generous grading policy. If you attend 80% of your weekly assigned TA office hours section, you'll be guaranteed at least a C- as a final grade--you don't even have to take the final if you do not want to if you decide you want to accept your C-. This grading policy benefits me as someone who does not really find importance in learning the content in this class in a serious manner. If you're just a CS major trying to get through the CS core and trying to get fundies over with and believe that C's get degrees, I would recommend this class. Aside from that, Rubenstein seems like a nice and cool guy that likes to throw some dad jokes and memes occaisionally. His powerpoints are like 100-200 slides on average and he SPEEDS through them in lecture, so don't expect to understand any of the content when first going into class--it'll require reading over the slides in your own time to understand.",

The standard deviation was consistently 30+ points, so I was disappointed in my final grade despite loving the class and feeling like I understood the material pretty well.\r\n\r\nBesides the grading, I really liked this class. I seem to be in the minority of people who consider the material interesting. It's basically an overview of low-level software and hardware--we learn about circuits, computer architecture, memory, assembly language, a lot of of physical stuff that most CS majors are happy to ignore. You might not like it just because you don't like the content, which is valid. If you try to think of everything as a puzzle, it might become more interesting to you.\r\n\r\nThere were weekly homework assignments that counted for 10% of your final grade. They were actually quite helpful for understanding class concepts. Since they were very low stakes (graded out of three points) I didn't have to worry too much about getting everything correct. I could just try to put in good effort and ask my TA to explain the rest. I loved the p-credit office hour setup. I felt like I was able to connect with my TA more and learned a lot from him--I was lucky to get a really good TA. I learned a lot in this class because the homework setup encouraged learning instead of punishing mistakes and TAs were very accessible.\r\n\r\nThe exams were kinda meh. I felt like the instructors were not very generous with partial credit or were constrained to strange restrictions, and that's why the STD was so big. Professor Rubenstein provides many resources for studying though (including one past exam that includes pictures of him dancing, what a riot).\r\n\r\nProfessor Rubenstein himself is clearly incredibly smart. I could tell because he would often make up examples on the spot or work through an example he already had without relying on his notes. His improv skills, however, were not quite as high. He sometimes got a little confused or lost in the details, which would in turn confuse the class. He could improve a lot if he would just make sure his live problem solving matched up with any lecture notes he wrote before class! His slides are detailed and beautiful. He's also clearly a bro. He was fun to have as a professor, and I wished he taught another class just so I could take it with him.\r\n\r\nMuch love from pb&jae. Keep lifting!",

                "content": "This class is a real mixed-bag. On the one hand, the course does a wonderful job of bridging the gap between understanding simple circuitry to how programs run on a processor \"under-the-hood\". On the other hand, the course structure and execution can be a bit daunting (and frustrating) for many students.\r\n\r\nCovering the material *completely* is nearly impossible. Moreover, teaching it in a way that reinforces *understanding* rather than *memorizing* is really quite a challenge. To accomplish this, Prof. Rubenstein has taken the tactic of presenting quite abstract (and hypothetical) problems for homework and test questions. I have a feeling that this is the crux of why a lot of students struggle in this class.\r\n\r\nGetting good at answering his \"type\" of questions is definitely a skill in-and-of itself. They typically require a combination of brute reading comprehension (to understand what the problem is asking), parallel thinking (to see the \"trick\" of the solution), and deep understanding of the concepts in order to identify the critical step in the solution. Once you understand the trick, the solution typically follows from the general concepts (rather than a concrete list of steps).n Again -- I have a feeling that this is why many students feel lost -- because this type of parallel thinking is hard to teach. It comes naturally to some students, and is quite difficult for others.\r\n\r\nThis method is great for confirming understanding, but really, *really* punishes students who need extra time to wrap their head around the problem before tackling it. The tests are laid out such that if you don't \"get\" the problem quickly, it can really set you back. This can be quite troubling to students, as the grading scheme is basically entirely built around performing quickly and accurately under pressure on the tests. (In contract, the rest of the grade is based on TA-office hour attendance, and homework completion -- both of which, most students max out on).\r\n\r\nI really like Prof. Rubenstein as a person -- he's fun, and personable, and has a great (albeit somewhat whimsical) sense of humor. As a professor, he's a bit on the scatterbrained side. It's obvious he understands the material, but the way he walks through it in class fluctuates between spending way too much time on repetitive concepts, or not quite getting to the critical point on more in-depth concepts. Either way, communicating the subject matter in an effective way is quite a tall order, so I tend to cut him some slack. I really dislike the grading scheme, but I'm not sure I could come up with something more fair/appropriate. \r\n\r\nOn a more specific note, Prof Rubenstein has a habit of coming up with completely outlandish analogies to explain concepts. Unfortunately, I more often found myself using my understanding of computers to decipher the analogy rather than using the analogy to further my understanding of computing. To provide an analogy to illustrate this teaching style, it would be as if I was ordering dinner, and I didn't know whether I wanted the steak or the chicken or the pork, so the chef went ahead and cooked all three, then just started putting them in front of me until I either saw something I liked or just nodded and asked \"why are you giving me food? this is a computing class!\" -- but instead of a chef making food, it's Prof. Rubenstein making analogies, and at this point the whole metaphor breaks down, because I really didn't think it through entirely before i started typing... and if you're even more confused by this, then you now understand what some of the analogies feel like. (As an aside, his washing machine analogy was spot-on. high-five, dude)\r\n\r\nAnyways, I digress. If I made any mistakes in this review, I'll fix it in the slides on piazza.",

He is an awful lecturer and an extremely lazy teacher. It takes forever for the TAs to return hws. His assignments and tests are impossible to comprehend, filled with typos and convoluted sentences. The TA's rarely understood the hws themselves. Most of them took the class with Martha Kim and did not understand why Rubenstein would teach the material the way he did. They had to spend half the time you met with them just figuring out what he was asking. The averages in this class were extremely low. Yes, averages are often low in comp sci courses, but in this class it wasn't simply because of the difficulty. It was because no one understood the material because he can't teach!!!! After the midterm grades came back he came in front of the class and said that we shouldn't complain about the average being so low because we're columbia students and tests are supposed to be hard at Columbia. He constantly tells you not to worry about grades because they don't matter, which is just annoying. I learned more from a 10 minute youtube video than from 75 minutes in his class.

                "content": "It's very rare to find a professor that genuinely cares about their students, but Dan Rubenstein is one of them. He might not be the best lecturer I've ever had (more specifics on that later), but he is undoubtedly one of the most helpful and caring professors I've had at Columbia.\r\n\r\nLECTURES:\r\n\r\nLike I said, objectively speaking, Rubenstein isn't the best lecturer I've had, but by no means is he a \"bad\" lecturer. Really, his biggest problem is that he needs to ditch the slides a bit. Instead of going through examples on a powerpoint, he'd be better off going through them on the board. It can get messy that way (with all the circuits and whatnot), but to combat that he could just post the examples on courseworks for reference. The occasional times he did problems on the board, I found them to make so much more sense than following along with the slides, and that's because, at the end of the day, he's actually good at explaining concepts in the course. With that said, see the Office Hours section for why you should go to them because they are/were super helpful. \r\n\r\nTo elaborate more on him as a lecturer, he does NOT read straight from the slides. He glances at them before speaking to remind himself what's on the slide, but he doesn't read straight from them. In fact, I think he blatantly avoids doing so because he knows that wouldn't be very helpful. \r\n\r\nAlso, his analogies and stories are not only hilarious, but make the classes/material memorable. Anyone who doesn't enjoy these bits of class seriously has no sense of humor. \r\n\r\nHe does explain concepts too many times- I know it's because people don't get them the first or even second time around, but hearing the same concept did get tedious sometimes.\r\n\r\nAlso, people complain so much about the occasional mistakes he makes on a slide, but really, I think we just need to relax a bit and recognize that he is a human being. We make mistakes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMEWORKS:\r\n\r\nDifficult and long, but super important for doing well in the class- not because they're worth so much of your grade, but because they're really important for gaining a good grasp of the material. Rubenstein is very purposeful in the questions he chooses, so really understanding each one is important.\r\n\r\nI will say though- the MIPS assignment was somewhat unreasonably hard, though graded extremely generously. I liked learning MIPS in the beginning, but I think holding off this hardcore assignment more towards to the last third of the semester would have served us better. I feel like most people didn't get as much as they could've from the assignment because it was just too soon to be given that hard of an assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDTERM:\r\n\r\nSuper hard. It was a huge time crunch- I didn't even get to read the last question (of 4) or truly attempt the third question, which means I essentially left half the test blank. And I wasn't a rare occurrence. With that said, the average ended up being a 42, so it all worked out in the end, I suppose~ \r\n\r\nHis tests are super hard, but they do drive us to really have to know the material. He warned us at the beginning that he tests this way to really get whether or not we understand the material. If you understand it and can apply it, then you'll be fine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL:\r\n\r\nEasier than the midterm- the average was a 62 and it was very reasonable. It wasn't technically cumulative (but the material builds on itself, so it sort of is at the same time). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOURS: \r\n\r\nHis office hours are great, and if you can make them, you should make every effort to do so. Every time I went to office hours, it was a valuable experience and he's so willing to go through anything you don't understand at whatever pace you need. His office hours get a bit busy around the time homeworks are due (still totally useful though because people ask good questions, which I always learned from, too), but going to his office hours when there's maybe one other person or no one else is great because you'll get his full attention. This is good advice for pretty much all professors, but unlike a lot of people/professors, he won't make you feel dumb if you don't know something - even if it's a simple concept. Don't be afraid to go- he's seriously such a nice guy. He might come off as intimidating at first, but he really is a nice person and at the end of the day, just cares that his students learn the material. \r\n\r\nThe only problem was that he had his office hours in the same class sequence at the same time (i.e. Tuesday/Thursday from 11am-12pm), which made it really hard/impossible to make office hours if you have a class during a portion of that time. I had a 10:10 and an 11:40, but if the 10:10 hadn't ended early lots of times or I didn't accidentally sleep through it occasionally, I would have never been able to make his office hours, so if you're in his class, really try to get him to not have office hours in the same class sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPS:\r\n\r\n1. Goes without saying, go to his office hours. Not only useful, but he apparently takes office hour appearance into consideration when grading at the end.\r\n\r\n2. He's a chill professor- get to know him. Also, he does research on networks and that's pretty cool. \r\n\r\n3. Skim the textbooks if you want, but don't read them religiously because Rubenstein does a good enough job that you don't need to read the textbook. If you want to read them though, they're actually not too bad of a read.  \r\n\r\n4. Do his practice midterm/final problems!\r\n\r\n5. Go to class. Seriously, you pay/get financial aid to go here and Rubenstein is both good and entertaining. Why skip if you don't have to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL WORD:\r\n\r\nStudents tend to have a preference for Martha Kim's version of the class, but I think a large portion of that is because her class is easier (And that is the attributed reason at least half the time)- she doesn't go into the material as in-depth (at least according to the lectures, which I've looked through), so the tests and homeworks are much easier (I've gone through them for practice). So with that said, if you're looking for the easier class, then sure, take Fundamentals in the fall with Martha Kim (she is also very nice and a good lecturer as well), but if you're looking for the class that will make you/cause you to learn more and know the material a lot better, then Rubenstein's your bet. He'll challenge you and you'll hate him temporarily when you're coding his MIPS assignment at 3 in the morning, but at the end, you'll have gained so much knowledge that you'll realize it was worth the struggle.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I had a great class experience with him, especially because I appreciate professors whose main goal is to challenge and have us learn and is willing to go the extra mile to make that happen.\r\n",

I'm aware that Rubenstein is not teaching fundamentals next semester, but I don't care, because the world needs to know how fucking terrible he was for fundamentals, so that hopefully nobody will have to go through it if he ever teaches it again.\r\n\r\nTHE LECTURES:\r\n\r\nProf. Rubenstein reads from his slides. Word-for-word. The lectures are aggressively boring, to the point where Rubenstein himself would get bored\u2013\u2013at which point he would tell a bizarre and completely unrelated story (\"So this one time I had a 6AM flight, and I was staying at the airport, so I told my friend I could wake up at 5:45 and make the flight, and then I actually did it, just to see if I could, but I forgot that security still takes like two hours even if you're sleeping in the airport, so I ended up missing that flight. Anyway\")\u2013\u2013and then get back to some of the most amazingly uninspiring lecturing I have ever witnessed. I can't believe I consistently went to this class. It's a waste of time.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMEWORKS:\r\n\r\nAlways tedious, and the questions are often extremely unclear. Unfortunately, the homeworks are only tangentially related to the slides/the classes, so 80 percent of the work you'll be doing on these homeworks is figuring out what he actually wants you to do. There were 8 graded homeworks this semester\u2013\u2013there were supposed to be 9, but somehow, even though we do literally nothing in class, Rubenstein fell behind, so that there was a 9th ungraded one (but it was still fair game for the final!)\r\n\r\nTHE TESTS:\r\n\r\nAs annoying as the homeworks are, the tests are a worse version of the homeworks. Completely unrelated to the tasks you do for the HW and the slides, these tests are difficult, confusing, and don't really reflect your understanding of the material. Every question introduces a new concept, so that you will be scrambling to read through his (often error-riddled) questions until you figure out the game for that particular question.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN HIMSELF:\r\n\r\nThe thing is that I actually kind of like Rubenstein\u2013\u2013he can be funny and he's kind of a goofball. But he is just a truly bad teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, for your own sake, don't take fundamentals with him.",

He spent the first lecture telling us how last year's culpa reviews were all wrong, and at first I thought it was going to be okay but then...\r\n\r\nOkay, okay. So he's not the worst. It could always be worse. I survived the class and learned some cool stuff. And yeah, he's a nice guy and a great person. But when every sample final exam that he gives us has at least one mistake in it, and when he doesn't even know the answers to his own homework problems... It makes me pretty worried.\r\n\r\nI actually don't think that he was that bad of a lecturer and I didn't really mind that the slides had some typos (though I'd maybe recommend not scribbling all over the whole slide in red... I heard someone got him a stylus but I don't think that helped much). He was decently helpful during office hours too, and he does seem to really care about us learning.\r\n\r\nThe main problems were the homeworks and exams. As a previous reveiwer mentioned, homeworks were posted late and graded late and sometimes tedious, but that wasn't even the worst part. Towards the end, some of his homeworks would ask questions to which he didn't even realise the answer, until a student pointed something out to him in office hours. He then tried to say that it was still an answer too but, c'mon, when the question asks \"How can you minimize stalling?\", \"you actually can't\" shouldn't be the answer.\r\n\r\nOur own midterm had a few very significant typos in it (he gave an example of how his state machine worked and his example contradicted the instructions) and our final had a few errors too. Luckily, he grades on a pretty good curve. I didn't think I was doing amazing but I ended up with an A.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you're stuck taking this class with Rubenstein, it's okay, just keep up with the material, go to office hours if you need to, and find some friends in the class to cry with when you can't handle it. And hope that he's a bit more organized next year. If you have a choice though, I'd recommend trying Kim.",

You would expect a professor who has taught this class several times in the past to know his material by now and have error-free slides. While some of these mistakes were corrected, there are still plenty of typos in his lecture slides, so be aware of that when studying from them. Also, logistics are poorly organized with HWs being posted late and taking forever to be graded.\r\n\r\nStarting with basic logic gates, the course slowly builds up towards creating a CPU. You learn about the underlying hardware behind a simple computer and how the programs you write actually work. The material in the first half of the class can be a bit boring, but you see how everything comes together when discussing the MIPS architecture, which is pretty cool. I was bored because of the slow start (I took Intro to EE and CS Theory before Fundamentals, so the first month was just a rehash of things I already knew). Hence, I never participated or really cared about was going on. Rubenstein would also give students points for discovering errors in his slides, and I felt like it detracted from the class because it \"gamifies\" education. Sometimes I would notice mistakes in the slides and not bring them to his attention because I didn't want to partake in his silly point system. Also, the homeworks were super tedious and didn't teach you much. They aren't representative of the harder yet more thought-provoking questions he asks on his exams.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was hard. It was longer than the practice tests, and it was nearly impossible to finish within the allotted time. It also had a couple of typos. His exams are open book, but it doesn't really help much because the questions he asks on exams generally require you to extend circuitry covered in class and solve problems creatively. He has good intentions for his exams. They are designed to make students think by asking non-trivial and interesting problems, but they're poorly executed because of the often long and winding questions or just because Prof. Rubenstein didn't think the solution through enough leading to a different answer than what he expected. Partly because of my attitude towards class and because of the difficulty of the test, I did pretty badly on the midterm.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the class, I made an active effort to pay attention. I found the course much more enjoyable (may have been because the material became more interesting) and Prof. Rubenstein a much better teacher. He's pretty helpful in Office Hours, so please go to them if you get stuck. The final was better than the midterm because I actually cared about the material and also because of the extra time we had. In the end, what you get out of this class depends on how much effort you put into it. Rubenstein's not the most inspiring teacher, so unless you take the effort to ask him good questions, classes can be pretty boring. You have to push him to take an interest in teaching you.\r\n\r\nI think, overall, it might be better to take Fundamentals with Martha Kim for now. Rubenstein's not bad, but there's a lot he can do to improve Fundamentals. (He also reads CULPA reviews, so I hope he makes the class better in the future).",

That happened because I attended office hours each week for assistance on understanding and completing the homework. Contrary to others' claims, I learned more in the class by having the opportunity to effectively discuss the questions and solutions to the HW with great TA's and with the professor. If you showed up with relative knowledge of the material, the professor or TA's would literally give you the answer if you couldn't reach it yourself. They sought to totally set you up for success. If you didn't take advantage of that assistance, that is your fault and I don't feel bad for you. \r\n\r\nThe criticism I have for this class amounts to concerns about interest by the professor. I don't believe Professor Rubenstein is teaching material he prefers to teach or learn. This results in a class that is less enjoyable, and is unfortunate at Columbia. His course would be 10X better if he enjoyed what he taught, and showed that. That being said, he showed he cares for his students' performance and puts in his stated time to assisting students. \r\n\r\nI wish I had purchased the book. I think the summaries he provided were at times challenging to understand. I also wish the course had a bit more of a clear connection and purpose between the first half of the semester and second, but we always have concerns. \r\n\r\nThe perspective is this - We can read, understand, draw, and design circuits that do cool shit. And if you can't, you screwed up in class and I don't feel bad for you. And you also probably cheated off someone else's homework so fuck you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is because engineering students are already exposed to digital circuits in 1201, and are generally more comfortable with design at this level of abstraction.\r\n\r\nRubenstein's slides were very detailed, and I never once needed to look at the textbooks.  While his assignments and slides did sometimes contain errors, he fixed them right away.  He also posted several practice exams, which were very useful in preparing for the midterm and final.  \r\n\r\nI do wish that he worked through his examples on the blackboard instead of showing them on slides.  Also, it would have been nice if he could have found more ways to engage students during class.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that Rubenstein is a good professor, since ultimately I learned a lot from his course.",

In any case take, everything with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\nNow there are a factors here that contributed to this that are beyond Rubenstein's control and are my fault, such as the fact that I don't really have a background in computer science, I never went to his office hours (I did attend the TA's occasionally), and I'm a second semester senior.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Rubenstein's style is that of the prototypical SEAS professor. There's a certain level of irony to this, because in his lectures he comes across as personable guy, he speaks English quite well, and he has a great sense of humor, none of which are very typical for engineering professors I suppose. However, none of that means shit if you spend all your lectures expressionlessly reading off slides, do not provide a good text book and assign cryptic error-riddled homeworks expecting people to be able to solve them purely based on what you wrote on those self-same slides. These slides, as the previous reviewer pointed out are also often riddled with errors. Moreover, they are quite repetitive and there are only a few that are truly important in every lecture, whereas the rest seemed like useless filler. Then there are topics that show up that aren't covered very well in the slides on both homeworks and tests. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I'm pretty sick of this en vogue teaching style where professors don't have to do anything except for recite from slides. It's not conducive to learning, and yet somehow the super-genius professors of SEAS still haven't figured out why people don't attend their classes. Or more likely they have, they just don't give a shit, since giving a shit about their students is not high on their priority list. This obviously wasn't the first class where this has happened, and I sincerely doubt it will be the last. The true tragedy here is that Rubenstein seemed well enough aware, occasionally stopping in the middle of his lectures to ask the class if they understood what he just said, and when less than half the class raised their hand, he would proceed to explain the exact same concept all over again in the exact same way.  This created the illusion of concern, while truly accomplishing nothing at all. \r\n\r\nAgain, it may be harsh or nigh impossible for me to claim he didn't care when I never went to his office hours; however, generally speaking, his lecturing style came off as lazy and unconcerned, which puts him squarely in the \"average\" range for SEAS professors. As far as attending office hours goes, he said that if we could show him we knew what we were talking about in office hours it could only help our grade. Unfortunately his lectures were often so devoid of content, I actually didn't learn very much, so I truly didn't know what I was talking about and probably deserved the C. \r\n\r\nSo I guess you should take him if you want a lecturer with an interesting personality and sense of humor and have a pretty good background in this stuff.

                "content": "There was not much I liked about the course taught by Rubenstein. The best days in class were when Edwards/Kim came in to sub for Prof Rubenstein when he was out.\r\n\r\nThe worst offenses:\r\n* He is not prepared enough for the lectures in order to make the material engaging or easy to understand. They consist of him reading off of his overly complicated slides and often not coming up for air.\r\n* He does not require a textbook but suggests two textbooks. His slides are basically reproductions of the books. I had the textbooks and did not think that the slides were enough to understand the material by. I think it's unfortunate that he uses two books when the course could be summed up in one book. He should drop the awful Mano and Kime book.\r\n* His homeworks are a mixture of totally tedious repetitive nonsense (adding binary numbers excessively) which teach little, to extremely esoteric circuit creations which also do little to explore your understanding of the material. Perhaps the course is meant to test your ability in solving puzzles through building circuits - if that is the goal then I guess I've misunderstood the intention of this course.\r\n* His homework policy is to allow for cheating. He allows people to collaborate on the assignments which in my opinion discourages anyone from doing their own work. For those that do their own work and do not compare answers before submission are just out of luck I guess. If you submit without comparing your answers and knowing you have 100% going in, I guess your'e a dope. If the whole class is allowed to collaborate why even give credit for the assignment?\r\n* His exams are insanely unfair in my opinion. After having done reasonably well on the homework assignments I felt unprepared for the midterm/final. There are some reasonable questions but then there are those that will boggle the mind how they accurately test my understanding and knowledge of the material. But again maybe I've failed to understand the goal of this course. His exams consisted of reading a mountain of text to explain the premise of creating some new fangled circuitry. Then having questions part b through d rely on your successful understanding and completion of part a. It doesn't help that in this mountain of text it is mostly incoherent explanation of what he is trying to express. My impression is that they were overly complicated and/or error filled.\r\n* I have had some minor experience with this course's topic before and usually find it fascinating but I found myself unwilling to participate towards the end.\r\n* The course covers too much ground and not enough of it carefully. There seems to be a theme that a lot of what we are learning is not necessary to know. That's insane to me. Everything we learn should be at least interesting and inform our future. Cut out the small extraneous that have no relevance.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n* He is a nice guy and office hours are very useful.\r\n* When he would work out a problem manually on the board this was a very useful exercise. Often I think he would realize the absurdity of certain questions when it would take him 20-30 minutes to complete.\r\n* He reads feedback and there was an adjustment to the pace of the class which at first was going a mile a minute for no reason.",

He wrote on the board for maybe two classes, and those were probably the classes that I actually learned the most. \r\n\r\nHomeworks are very repetitive and students often dreaded doing them because the questions were updated with corrected versions; we still only had one week to do them, so more often then not, I chose to start later in the week waiting for all the corrections to come out. \r\n\r\nAlso he is very terrible at answering emails (I put 3827 in the subject line of all of my emails!). Sometimes questions to homeworks would be answered after the homeworks were due. \r\n\r\nHe has very strict extension policies. A couple of my friends just got 0s on their homeworks because they were sick/absent/had religious reasons for missing the deadline.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't feel like Prof. Rubenstein's teaching was effective, at least for me.

I was initially hesitant to take this course because I was scared of the course material(circuits! circuits! and more circuits!), but professor Rubenstein presents does an amazing job of explaining things and his lectures are actually enjoyable. I, too, was somewhat worried after reading the old reviews, but now that I've taken a course with him, I know for a fact that those are not an accurate description of him. (Maybe his evil twin brother as someone suggested...) If you need to/want to take Fundamentals, by all means, take it with him.\r\n\r\nHe makes great lecture slides(that are actually better than the textbooks) and post them on the courseworks ahead of time. Some students just read over the lecture notes and do not attend the lectures, but I suggest not to do it because 1. the lecture notes are quite condense and hard to understand without the aid of lectures (at least for me)  and 2. it's one of the few classes where lectures are golden. His lectures are very interactive and he makes it obvious that he's enthusiastic about teaching (which can only help the students). Although the pacing can be somewhat fast at times, if a student asks a question, he'll slow down and explain to make sure the student understands the material. \r\n\r\nThere's about one homework per each week (9 HW total). Homeworks are reasonable, but can be tough. It depends on how much background knowledge you have (If you're good at circuits, you'll breeze through the first half of the course). Start at least 3 days before it's due and go to the office hr if you're having a hard time. His tests are open book/open note, but since he asks design questions, you have to have a solid understanding of the material. There's no surprise questions and he won't try to trick you, but will test you how much you understand the core of the material. Take HW problems seriously, as they will help you tremendously. \r\n\r\nOffice hrs literally saved me. This is the only course I attended office hrs on the regular basis. You come in with a question, and you will walk out with a full understanding of the material. If you have a schedule conflict with regular office hr, don't hesitate to email him and make an appointment. He truly cares about his students, and he'll make time for you. In fact, I never went to his regular office hr as I had another class during the time, but I never had a problem getting help whenever I needed. I got the questions that would take me 10 hrs to understand answered in 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nHe's approachable, funny, enthusiastic, and truly cares about the students. \r\nTake this course with him if you can, and you won't regret it. Interesting course material taught by a great instructor, what more to ask?\r\n\r\n",

He is one of the best professors I have had at Columbia in CS. After having taken both Fundamentals and Networks with him, I highly recommend him.\r\n\r\nHis lectures are spread between writing on the board and going over lecture slides that the textbook made. Both are pretty good, but when he writes on the board, he can go really fast. If you don't want to fall behind in class when he's writing on the board, don't copy everything down (though I did, and I often got lost). Listen though and ask questions. The textbook might serve as a good resource. I referred to it several times, but you could probably get away with just using Wikipedia. There's no assigned reading but he does cover nearly everything in the textbook (and more).\r\n\r\nHomeworks are reasonable. The first two programs are the hardest, but after that they just get easier (and even easier still). Do yourself a favor and do them in Java, trying to do the noble thing and programming in C just won't cut it. The first program will take 40+ hours in C, or 10 hours in Java. Your choice. You have plenty of time for the programs. The separate theory homeworks are assigned with only 1 week to do them (sometimes concurrently with the programs), so if you don't start early they can be tough.\r\n\r\nHis tests and theory problems work the same way. You learn the basic concepts in the class. Then you're asked questions that rearrange problems to something you've never seen before and are something that was covered in class. The only way you can do well is if you have a strong understanding of the material (obviously).\r\n\r\nHe is a fair/generous grader and a nice guy if you go to his office hours. Listen, ask questions in class, start the programs relatively early (and do them in Java!), know the concepts and you'll do fine. Usually the class has a low average too.\r\n\r\nDo take this course even if it's not required for your track.

                "content": "Overall, I think Daniel Rubenstein was an excellent professor. Specifically, the majority of his lectures were extraordinarily clear. He had well prepared slides for every class, often with plenty of well-chosen images from the textbooks, and spent most of the class time describing what was happening in the pictures. One of his greatest strengths was being able to clearly and succinctly describe and give insight into the functioning of a circuit or architecture. He was also unusually receptive to questions during class. By and large, the students asked thoughtful and helpful questions, and as a result, he was able to clarify almost all subtleties and potential pitfalls in the material. The lectures seemed all the more engaging and participatory as a result as well.\r\n\r\nAll this praise aside, I can how see professor Rubenstein may not be a good fit for every student. Specifically, to get the most out of this course, it is best to take a very active approach. I agree with a previous reviewer that \"it's best to ask a lot of questions and make sure to make it your responsibility to clarify all the material that is taught.\" As I mentioned above, one of the reasons that the professor was able to make the material so clear was that students asked questions whenever something was less than one hundred percent clear.\r\n\r\nAs for the course as a whole, it felt like a gradually unfolding adventure/mystery story. We took a thoroughly bottom-up approach, and starting from the absolute basics of binary logic, gradually added new layers of abstraction until we had essentially designed a computer out of nothing. I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see how all the ideas we looked at unfolded and built on each other to eventually construct such an amazing machine. Some of the ideas we covered, such as latches and flip-flops, are so utterly brilliant that I think it is somewhat of a shame that we never considered the engineers and inventors who were responsible for them. More generally, I think the ideas we covered in the class could have put into a richer historical context.",

A lot of the homework time was spent either doing tedious computations (multiplying numbers in floating point comes to mind), or delving into an annoying level of detail, such as describing what effect a small design change would have on dozens of instructions which were not all listed in the same place.

His slides are gorgeous, his lectures are unfailingly clear, and he's eager to help out outside of class.\r\n\r\nApparently he's used to teaching by drawing everything on the blackboard, but he had rotator cuff surgery early in the semester and had to do everything via PowerPoint to avoid damaging the muscles. Surprisingly, I think this turned out to be a good thing. Once you get into some of the scarier-looking circuitry, I imagine that it's easy to make make mistakes drawing, and I'm certain that it takes forever. This way, we got straight to (relatively) error-free drawings and spent time talking about the big picture instead of worrying about which wires cross.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of those rare classes where the material is interesting without being difficult. Five or six people in the class got perfect scores on the midterm, and I suspect a similar number aced the final. I don't think it's that Rubenstein makes the tests too easy -- this is just really straightforward stuff.\r\n\r\nThe few complaints I have are relatively minor. I think he was still a little sensitive about the last time he taught this course (with reviews like those, who wouldn't be?) and made a point of stopping to make sure everybody was following. This was nice, but the endless refrain of \"are you with me? Raise your hand if you understand\" got a little irritating by the end of the semester. He also seemed to get a little bit confused by some of his own notes about pipelined architectures, but everything worked out in the end.\r\n\r\nIn short, don't be scared off by any review written before 2009. This is a good class with a good instructor, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Prof. Rubenstein for Fundamentals.\r\n\r\nA side note:\r\nThe class nominally requires two textbooks. You can get by without buying either, but your life will be a little easier if you get Patterson and Hennesy. Don't bother with Mano and Kime -- it's almost completely useless.",

There are a few ways he can improve this class.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he teaches the class from a very theoretical point of view.  Considering this course is described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Introduction to computer networks,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he needs to focus less on the theory.  The theory he teaches is excessive to the point that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for me to follow how the theory relates to networking in real life.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with theory, but first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to learn something practical so that I know how to apply the theory.\r\n\r\nProf. Rubenstein clearly states that he does not follow the book.  I understand that many professors do not follow the book because they need to present material that relates more closely to the course.  Unfortunately, in this situation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big mistake.  Based on the course description, the material in the book is better than what Prof. Rubenstein teaches.\r\n\r\nCompared to other classes, Prof. Rubenstein also puts a lot of weight on the mid-term and final.  Based on the amount of effort I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to put in to the homework and programming assignments, I think the assignments should be a larger factor in the overall grade.  He barely teaches anything in class on how to do the programming assignments.  This leaves students with a lot of work although it only counts for a small portion of the grade.\r\n\r\nI would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve liked to learn about networking in this class, but unfortunately it looks like all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned is strange theory that I have no idea how to apply to real life.  I think Prof. Rubenstein could do a decent job teaching the course if he would just read the course description one more time and realize that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to teach anything other than what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presented in the textbook.  Save the theory for a different class, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give it to us in the introduction to networks class.\r\n",

It's best to ask a lot of questions and make sure to make it your responsibility to clarify all the material that is taught, because you can't expect that of this instructor. He really wants to make you understand, but because he is not very clear at it, it might be harder if you don't show you don't understand and don't ask questions. So, use office hours, study from the books often, and make sure you get everything clarified.\r\n\r\nAlso, he is very poor on expressing himself. On the final exam, one problem had a mistake in it because it was worded too awkwardly and ended up contradicting itself. This ended up being a big problem because we couldn't do much of the problem until the question was clarified. I ended up kinda guessing what he meant to ask. Also, the really bad part was that this was 1 out of 5 problems, and the next 2 problems built up on the one that had the error. Generally, very unclear demands.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you want to major in CS or EE, you probably have to take this class, so you don't get much choice.

                "content": "First of all, Rubenstein is a little insecure. At least that's the first impression he gave to me, and I write this knowing full well that he's going to read this review. In the introductory lecture, he spent a full five minutes explaining why the reviews of him that were posted on CULPA are unfair. \nWhile I've heard professors respond to CULPA reviews before, I've never seen anyone get so defensive about one. \nIt leaves you with the impression that he feels like he's got something to prove, which is unfortunate since he's not a bad teacher.\n\nUnfortunately, for all the time he spent preparing his defense of his CULPA reviews, he never really seemed to spend enough time preparing to teach the course. The fact that he doesn't like any of the books out there isn't by itself a problem, but he needs to understand that there are people who like to be able to use books as a reference, to supplement lectures. The fact that he didn't decide whether to teach the course top down or bottom up until the second lecture meant that he couldn't recommend a book that covers the material in the same order that he would. This meant that those of us who tried to use the book he suggested to help with the early material were stuck with references to things that wouldn't be covered until the end of the course. How difficult would it have been for him to take the time to make that decision just a few days earlier so that he could suggest a book that could complement his lectures?\n\nLikewise, despite requests from several students, he never produced any kind of schedule for the course. No one had any way of knowing what would be covered, when it would be covered, or when the assignments would be due. This was especially problematic around midterms, when people are trying to budget their time, and Rubenstein decided to give out the information pertinent to assignments at the very last minute.\n\nI don't have a problem with teaching networks from a theoretical perspective, but I wish he spent more time talking about networks early on and less time trying to justify his decision to teach the way he does. Furthermore, everyone in the class has already taken a stats course of some sort, since it's a prerequisite for the course. It really wasn't necessary to spend 3 lectures early on explaining about expected value, especially since there was no schedule that people who already understood stats could refer to so that they could skip the redundant sessions.\n\nThe assignments were the kicker. He's certainly not the first CS professor I've had who's extremely rigid about assignment deadlines, but usually the ones who are that rigid are obsessive compulsive about posting the assignments well in advance and making sure that the project specification is detailed enough to avoid problems. Instead, Rubenstein would give out assignments usually a day or three after he promised, only to have to go through several rounds of revisions to account for mutually contradictory requirements within the project. It's not that the assignments are bad, just that he doesn't seem to take enough prep time to really set them up properly ahead of time.\n\nAs for his exams, he takes great pride in making them hard, which is certainly his right. The trick is to understand that he'd always rather ask a question designed to trick people than directly test their understanding of the underlying concepts. While it's useful to understand the concepts, you need to go into his exams trying to find the places where he's trying to trip you up. Unfortunately, this means that performance on the tests is at least as much about your ability to outsmart Rubenstein as it is about whether or not you're learning about computer networks.\n\nAll told, don't go out of your way to take any classes with him. He's not bad at standing in front of a room and explaining things, but he seems thoroughly uninterested in spending sufficient time preparing to teach. As for the theoretical angle he likes to take, it's not as bad as the other review would indicate, I just wish he hadn't wasted everyone's time with remedial stats in order to do it.",

When we arrived, instead of bringing us delicious sushi, we were brought a dead fish that we had to dissect using our hands, all the while being criticized by the sushi chef for our poor technique.  We all left slightly sick to our stomachs and unlikely to try out sushi again anytime soon.\n\nYou won't get any big pictures here.  You won't learn about any actual protocols in use today.

Grinspun is a very well known and accomplished professor who is passionate about his work, as well as an enthusiastic and organized lecturer. Take this class late in your CS career - the more programming experience you have, the better.\r\n\r\nHomeworks are difficult, but you are provided with a code base that provides visual debugging tools, as well as a grading script with numerous tests that gives you an accurate idea of the performance (and final grade) of your code. All homeworks come with a PDF explaining the physics concepts behind the code for that week, and although there were some errors, the PDFs were for the most part very helpful, especially if you happened to miss a lecture. (In the case of mistakes in the PDF, extensions were often given)\r\n\r\nTo prepare: learn linear algebra, refresh your knowledge of differential calculus (mandatory), be a strong C++ programmer, and, although it is not listed in the course requirements, I STRONGLY recommend some kind of physics background. While Grinspun does go over this material in class, if you start with at least one college-level physics class under your belt, the lectures and homeworks will be much more comprehensible, and you won't waste time learning elementary physics.\r\n\r\nGrading: I include this section to discuss some grading policies I disagreed with. 85% of the homework grade comes from the \"bot\", or the test suite mentioned earlier. The other 15% comes from a mandatory creative scene, built by you to showcase the elements developed for that weeks milestone. At the beginning of the class, Grinspun said you do not need artistic skill to succeed in this class. However, I disagree. If your code works 100% according to the script, you could still get a B on the assignment if you fail to produce a good creative. These creatives are then judged by your peers, who determine the remaining 15% of your grade. Humorous creatives can outweigh visually pleasing creatives, so if you're in a time crunch, go for that. The professors and the TA's weigh in on these grades, so they may give you more points if they see technical ability not easily recognized by your peers.\r\nExtra credit is awarded for the top 5 creative scenes, and sporadic extra credit is offered throughout the semester on the homeworks (when it is offered, it is a lot! Do it!)\r\n\r\nExams: None. There is a final project worth the weight of two \"milestones\"/homeworks, which is left up to you. You could modify the code base to produce an extravagant creative, implement a technical paper, or implement algorithms from the class in an external software - whatever you want.\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you have any interest in computer graphics or animation, take this class. It will either weed you out, or light a fire under you to go farther in the field. It's a love-it or hate-it class, since you will have to really commit, but if you want to be in this field, you cant miss this opportunity.",

I cannot believe I have accomplished so much in one semester, and this class is simply one of the best class at Columbia that exceeds tuition fee that I pay for. In this class you will be exposed to pretty much everything in graphics pipeline. The awesome part is that you gotta have to sit down and implement real graphics program from scratch. It is a great class to let you see how technology and art can strengthen each other. And who wouldn't like a class that he/she can enjoy the two at the same time?\r\n\r\nEnough said with the class. Prof. Grinspun himself is also an extraordinary teacher. With his exclusive background in math, you will blow your mind to let you see how much graphics and math are inter-connected. In addition, because he is an excellent teacher who explains things from the perspective of someone who knows little about the subject, you can't go wrong with the materials. His humor and energetic teaching style will also motivates you to engage in the class, even if it is two hour class straight at night. There were multiple guest lectures, which feature people from the real industry, like NVIDIA for example, to talk about the technologies that people are engaging out there. After you have taken the class, you are sufficiently well-rounded in graphics.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are heavy. It is pain in the ass; it is self-tortured at times, but the reward can give you a life-time inspiration. My favorite part is that you will have chances to do something creative and get credits for them.

                "content": "Discrete Mathematics, as taught by Professor Grinspun, is a CS prerequisite I am very happy to be taking.  Professor Grinspun's computer graphics research is really cool, but that is outside the scope of this review.  The main strength of COMS W3203 is clarity.  Professor Grinspun's lectures are so understandable that I have not usually needed to read the textbook in depth.  If anything, they are too basic and move too slowly, although there is plenty of time to ruminate on the materials in class.  The textbook (by Kenneth Rosen) is also excellent, being both engaging and informative.  The difficulty and pacing of the course changed relatively little as the semester progressed, a teaching accomplishment in itself.    \r\n\r\nThe curriculum focuses roughly equally on proof-writing and problem-solving--a fair division, although I wish there had been more discussion of how Discrete Math can be applied.\r\n\r\nThe homework was where most of my learning took place, and it would have been a mistake not to do it as thoroughly as possible even if each assignment is only 4 percent of the grade.  (Not everyone does their homework thoroughly.)  Homework is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for preparing for the three exams, which are long and complicated exercises in problem-solving and proof-writing speed.  As a warning, almost no one could finish the second midterm exam.  This includes some of the best remaining students.  Fortunately, the exams' open-book nature and the grading curve meant they were actually easier than exams in many other classes.  The 6 homework assignments were 9 to 20 handwritten pages each, and each one usually took me 10-20 hours to finish.  Many questions were difficult, and office hours often saved me.  \r\n\r\nThis course has a high attrition rate--perhaps one-third to more than half of the original students choose to drop it after the first lecture, including some of Columbia's best and brightest.  There might be several reasons for this.  Professor Grinspun calls on students unannounced and does not hesitate to embarrass them (although I never saw him embarrassing anyone unprovoked).  Homework 1 was as difficult as the other assignments, which may have led some students to believe the course would be more demanding than it actually was.  The heavily proof-oriented nature of Discrete Math may also have scared off some.  In my opinion, DROPPING THIS COURSE INSTEAD OF PRESSING THROUGH IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.  My experience was that around week 4 of the course, proofs suddenly became less intimidating and around week 5 or 6, Professor Grinspun mellowed out.  What students contend with is a not especially time-consuming commitment, as CS courses go, and possibly one of the 5 best undergraduate courses in the CS department.  I enjoy it, and would strongly recommend it to students with the appropriate background (some introduction to programming such as COMS W1004; pre-calculus or, better yet, calculus; and, if you're really concerned about writing proofs, the supposedly well-taught Introduction to Higher Mathematics).",

His lectures are worth going to, not only because he explains things well but because his jokes are surprisingly funny.

As for the subject itself, the book is pretty poor and has examples that are ridiculously easy compared to the exercises.

We spent half of the time in the course joking around with him and he really listens to his students. The book mostly sucks, the examples are all way over-simplified to really help with the homework, but Prof Grinspun does a good job of getting the whole class to work out more difficult examples during class. The TAs said that Eitan was the nicest professor they've ever TAed for and it seems to me they were right, his tests and homework assignments were very very fair and he encouraged the TAs to be easy graders. It's probably a bad idea to skip the class unless you have a friend whose a good note-taker because he does go over material/ do the aforementioned really useful problems during lecture that aren't in the book. He's almost always a few minutes late to class though. The class is pretty easy if you're a CS/compE major but if you're having trouble with something Eitan's totally accesible and willing to help you. After I did not so great on the first problem set, he was willingly 10 minutes late for a collegue's talk just so he could finish going over example problems for the midterm with me.",

Regarding Pasik's coding style, I don't think there's any reason to make too big of a fuss--it may be slightly different in certain aspects from how other people would code, but it really doesn't make things any more difficult.",

I've had a couple professors with silver nuggets who are great, but Professor Pasik is not one of them. \r\n\r\nPasik's class has a couple problems:\r\n\r\n1) his TAs. They are almost all jaded graduate/PhD students. In our case, 2 left throughout the semester, so as a result, all our assignments came back late. He did not hire new ones. They made TONS of grading errors, so make sure to go to office hours to check up on your quizzes. \r\nFinally, their rubrics are sometimes laughable. They award lots of points for the simplest things, and few for the most difficult parts.\r\n\r\n2) the structure of his class. He starts by covering a new topic with slideshow-supported lecture (slideshows posted on CourseWorks), consisting mostly of code and some text here and there. \r\n\r\nAfter each major topic (every 4 lectures or so), there's a quiz. Memorizing his code is a surefire way to get an A on these quizzes -- if you don't look at the code and didn't follow the lecture, expect to fail the quiz. Winging it is pretty tough. That being said, I failed two quizzes, but then scored significantly above the average for one I didn't study for at all. Why? No idea.\r\n\r\nAfter the quiz, you may or may not have a programming assignment. The programming assignment will probably be super easy.\r\n\r\n3) his code. Like people have said below, his code is extremely, extremely dense. He prides himself on brevity, but there is essentially a learning curve to reading his code (which shouldn't be the case, since you already know Java if you're taking this class). He teaches bad style that is not based on Java.\r\n\r\n4) him. Pasik is arrogant, but more importantly he doesn't hold regular office hours, so if you want to see him, either deal with his awful TAs or schedule an appointment.\r\n\r\n5) emphasizes weird things. We barely spent any time on hash tables and hash maps, but then spent tons of time on miscellaneous artificial intelligence topics at the end of the course, just because he enjoys them. You are learning the wrong material!\r\n\r\nTl;dr: please, please take a different section. This class is a crapshoot -- I never knew why I was getting the grades I did. I really regret not having actually put off data structures for another semester until another professor came along. This guy is no good.",

It is true that he only ends up coming to class about 2/3 of the time since there's 4 quizzes, 4 review sessions, and 1 final. When he's there though, he's very passionate and often quite amusing. I also found that between the lectures and the programming assignments I came out with a very thorough understanding of what he covered. Beware though that his programming style is extremely bizarre so you may pick up some weird habits.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes were kind of mini-midterms -- they took the whole class but only counted for 10% of your grade and only covered 3-4 lectures worth of material.

Learned a lot but only because this is material that I hadn't been exposed to in other classes and I could have learned 3 times as much had Pasik not ended class half an hour early (on average) every class and skipped 8 classes for review sessions/midterms. Additionally, it should not have been required to learn LISP which wasted an additional 2 weeks at the beginning where we didn't learn any AI. He also cancelled a class at the end because he didn't have anything else to teach us. Overall, if you consider that he only used about 2/3 of the allotted class time, we had about 10 lectures on AI for the whole semester. How do courses at CMU, Stanford, MIT and Cornell manage to do fill a whole semester? \r\nAs stated in other reviews, all of his lectures are taken totally out of the book, except the knowledge representation lectures. In these lectures, rather than covering the interesting material on epistemic logic that the book had, he spent the entire time on algorithms for expert systems which haven't really been used since the 90s.\r\nHe also arbitrarily set his curve to a B-/C+ which would be fine except no other professor in the department does that.\r\nBasically Artificial Intelligence is an extremely interesting field and the fact that I am still interested in it despite Pasik is a testament to the material.

                "content": "If tl;dr, just scroll to bottom.\r\n\r\nOf the three CS classes I've taken so far at Columbia, this was hands down the worst of all of them. Prior to enrolling in the class, I read the reviews here on CULPA and figured that the people complaining about Pasik's teaching style and glossing over LISP and other concepts were simply whiners. It took me 3 lectures to completely reverse my initial opinion. Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not disgruntled because I did poorly in the class (even without the extra credit, I would've gotten an A). I'm bitter about enrolling in this class because it was nothing short of a waste of time and money.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the semester, I've come to realize that Pasik really doesn't put in that much effort into teaching. Here's why: of the 28 days that the class was scheduled to meet, 8 of them were committed to other activities (6 reviews, 2 exams). Of these review sessions, Pasik shows up to exactly one. While I thought the review session that he conducted was actually the best among all of them (probably because the subsequent reviews were horrific), he prepared no material and basically held an hour-long Q&A section. Moreover, he canceled one additional class, and ended at least 5 classes 20+ minutes early. So all-in-all, instead of using 28 days to teach, he effectively taught for roughly 18. The result of this is that we barely covered any material. A simple google search of Artificial Intelligence syllabi from top institutions like Stanford, CMU, MIT, etc, reveals that we covered about 1/3 of the material they did. And that's a generous estimate. I have one word for that: pathetic.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of Pasik's teaching that many of my classmates found irritating was the fact that he read directly off of his slides. In the past during my undergrad years, and even this past semester, I've had professors that used PowerPoint slides extensively. Sometimes, they even read off of the slides verbatim just like Pasik. This I have no problem with. What annoyed me the most was the dearth of content in those slides and how cryptic most of them were. This can be especially frustrating when some of the material he presents is not covered in the book, and the only source of reference you have is a figure of a rectangle with a few splotches of color that's supposed to represent the effectiveness of parallelism.\r\n\r\nFinally, a feature of Pasik's teaching that I found to be ineffective and even counterproductive was his insistence on going over code in class. I think the main problem with this is that code in LISP is not readable. The task of keeping track of what all the different built-in functions in LISP do in addition to the user-defined functions Pasik writes results in students being confused as everything becomes just one huge convoluted mess. I think that the time spent in analyzing LISP code would be better spent if the algorithms were presented in pseudo-code (mostly in ENGLISH) rather than actual code. Since the course is comprised of mostly grad students, converting pseudo-code to LISP code should not be hard once the students actually understand what the program is supposed to do. \r\n\r\nIs Pasik a nice guy? I wouldn't know since he has no office hours and is only transiently available before and after class. I stopped emailing him questions shortly after term started since his responses are one-liners and don't really answer your more complicated questions. Maybe it's because he's involved in many other activities that doesn't give him time prepare and do the material justice. I get it, professors are busy people. But there's a line between being a busy person and simply not giving a damn.\r\n\r\nBottom line: if your main objective is to get an easy A, this course is the one for you. If you want to actually learn something, take a different class.",

If there's ever anything you don't understand he's more than happy to explain it to you. Unfortunately his office hours are practically non-existent, but he's always around for about half an hour before class, and for as long as you need after.\r\n\r\nThe course was taught in LISP, but if you're not familiar with this language, don't worry. He usually spends some time at the beginning of the semester explaining the basics, and none of the assignments require any really advanced level knowledge of LISP. If you get stuck, you can almost always find what you need with a little Googling. \r\n\r\nHis lectures are interesting and if you show up consistently and take thorough notes, you may not even need the textbook. Be warned, you will hear lots of stories about him and his family's zany adventures, but he's a good story teller and there's always an AI related moral in the end.\r\n\r\nAs another person pointed out, there is a lot of discussion about the philosophy of AI, but if you look up, you'll see that the name of this class is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Artificial Intelligence Programming\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, it's just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Artificial Intelligence\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The history and theory of AI are relevant to the course, even if they're not all that relevant to the grade. There will be some readings on this and probably one question on one test somewhere. If you decide to skip it all together it won't kill you, but it is interesting and might even help you out a little on the homeworks.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are deceptively complex, but they're not very difficult once you figure out what you're supposed to be doing. Give yourself some time. You're not going to bang them out in one night, but you can get them done over the weekend if you don't have much else to do.\r\n\r\nThe tests are sort of cumulative. It's usually around 3/4 new material and 1/4 old material. Expect a coding question, usually just a variation of something from the homework. He expects you to know all the algorithms by name so be sure you've go that down. Pasik will tell you himself that if you do the homework early you'll be pretty well prepared for the test and this is definitely true.",

The assignment descriptions sound straightforward and manageable, at first. It is when you start to work on it that you realize you know WHAT the homework means (that is all the lectures are good for), but not HOW to implement it. Most of the time will be spent figuring out how the program should work, even in a conceptual way, in order to achieve the algorithm that Pasik wants. \r\n\r\nThis is made harder because (a) You are using Lisp for probably the first time, a language that is not used anywhere outside academia and will never be useful to you again. No other language you have learned or lab you have taken in CS at Columbia will prepare you for understanding Lisp except the concept of recursion (b) You will not learn, during lectures, the Lisp you need to do the homework. After the first couple lectures, Pasik will not continue to teach Lisp and consider everyone a \"Lisp expert\" (c) You will spend hours reading Lisp primers before you actually work on the program. For this reason (and the fact that you have 3 other CS classes to worry about), the assignments will most likely lead to several all-nighters. Pasik has a 1-point-per hour deduction late policy, which is the most ridiculous policy I've ever come across in a CS class. If a student must resort to submit late, do you really think it will be by a couple hours? For a class like this, 25% deduction per day is much more reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are brief (usually they take Pasik 30 min to get through), with a focus on definitions instead of Lisp-based, example-driven concepts. Typically, a lecture will have one or two high-level examples (i.e. a diagram or graph), and one or two, if at all, slides of lisp code that do not relate to the homework in any way and will not be useful for exams.\r\n\r\nAs for the exams, I really didn't mind them. They are straightforward. However, each question is usually 1 point out of 10 points, so four points off already puts you at 60. Pasik will not tell you what questions will be on the exam. The best method is to read the slides carefully and focus on definitions. Also, there will be a lisp question on each exam that relates to the homework (i.e. a snippet of code from your hw).",

                "content": "This class is a joke. Go to class, everyone says. And it is true, you should go to class if you really want to understand the material.\r\n\r\nWhat he does in class is he just goes over the coding that is on courseworks, first in general and then looking at the code itself. So for say, the linked lists, he would first explain what linked lists are, and then go over it in code. Of course, you really don't even need to take any notes, since if all you do is pay attention, you'll understand how the structures work and then you can just read the code to refine it even more.\r\nHe also let us out more than twenty minutes early multiple times, because that's how clear he makes the material.\r\n\r\nSo what makes this class a total joke? First, he assigns six homeworks. They aren't hard at all, and if you have a comp sci-major friend, they're actually easy. They don't take all that much time to do, and best thing, they're worth 50% of your final grade. 50% for six homeworks? Yup, he takes the \"lowest\" grade (you should be getting 10's on all the homeworks anyway) and adds it on as extra credit. If you have good enough friends, you should be getting ten points extra credit. Not only that, but on two of the assignments he had two MORE ways of getting extra credit: one was a simple, two line code, and the other was a bit tougher but still very doable, and he gave three points each for a grand total of sixteen points extra credit max. And note, these are on the HOMEWORKS, not on the tests that actually test your knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe tests make up the rest of your grade. Two midterms worth 15% each (15 points each) and a final worth 20% (20 points). They were also jokish. On each midterm he made sure to put at least one problem where you have to code, and one problem where it's a freebie 3 points if you went to class and listened (simple things like 'what is the time complexity of heapsort'). The final was a bit different: one tough problem, one very very easy problem (his freebie question worth 6 points, everyone should have gotten this one) and one coding (practically the same as the code in class). Even more, because all his midterms are point-based (they're out of 15 points), it's not like other classes where it's out of 100 and then scaled. What you get is how many points you add onto your final score, but with your sixteen points extra credit, you technically don't even have to take a midterm and you'll still get an A+. But even if you do, you're practically guaranteed an A+ unless you really don't know java, in which case you'll just get an A. He practically guarantees that everyone gets at least 7/15 points, so at most, if you aren't that good at java, you'll get 14/30 from the midterms. The final was much harder, but the TAs said that they graded generously, so you should probably get at least a 13/20 on the final, so that's 27/50, and then you add the free points from extra credit, and you get a 77/100, but then you add the extra credit and voila, you're back at a 93/100, and you get an A for doing so badly on the tests.\r\n\r\nDon't be scared when, in the first day of class he complains about grade inflation and describes how one standard deviation above the mean is a B and two standards is an A, because really, with that much extra credit (and the ease of this class), at least half the class got A-range grades.",

He's taught this course many times, so he knows what he's doing. There is a mad steep learning curve, starting with recursion. Once you get this, however, his code becomes a lot easier to understand. For each data structure, there is an abstract understanding of it, and there is a programming understanding. The conceptual understanding is more important; the programming is only important in the assignments (and he posts all his code on Courseworks anyway). His conceptual explanations makes use of diagrams, so recommend taking notes on pencil and paper. His explanation of each data structure is very systematic in this way.\r\n\r\nDoctor Pasik is very approachable, but only after class (he has no office hours). He always stays to answer all questions the students have; you can often get hints on the assignments this way. Additionally, he has lots of insight into the rest of computer science, and potentially a networking contact, depending on your desired industry.\r\n\r\nThe assignments can be difficult; however, you never have to work from the ground up (except the last one). You take his code from Courseworks, and using those basic methods, you build the rest of the methods to complete the assignment. Again, these additional methods require a conceptual understanding of what you are doing.\r\n\r\nHis grading style is interesting. There are 60 points worth of assignments (6 assignments, 10 points each), and 50 points worth of tests. To calculate the curve, he will take the 5 highest scores from everyone's assignments and the 50 points from the tests and calculate the average from that (curved to a B-). Then he'll add on the raw points from the 6th assignment to the score, boosting everyone's grades.",

Though his lectures are entertaining, they gloss over the course material and provide little to no insight into the concepts, test material, or homework assignments. He always ends class early, for such reasons as \"I'm going salsa dancing!\" When asked a question in class, he often doesn't know the answer and responds with some bs, or says he'll answer it next week with an example. Subsumption, for example, is not hard and something that he should be able to define and provide an example for on the spot, but he can't. His lectures have clearly not been updated in several years, and it shows. It seems like there are typos from the 90's that would take 2 seconds to fix, but doesn't bother to do anything to fix them.\r\n\r\nAll your homework is in LISP and Pasik barely covers LISP in class. Your knowledge of this language comes completely from independent study, and the homeworks are very time consuming. You would think that he could at least provide some sample LISP programs or god forbid tutorials that he quickly googled, but no, he leaves that up to you. As for the actual homeworks themselves, that are so vague and non-descriptive that you'll spend half the time trying to figure out what you have to do. Days or even hours before the due dates, TA's will post requirements on courseworks of things that you must include in the homework. He does not provide solutions to the homework, so you're screwed in that sense. He reuses the homeworks every single year, without changing them at all. This turns out to be bad because he could make the homework prompt more descriptive than 3 sentences. Be prepared to spend 40+ hours for each of the 3 homework assignments, and start them way early (you do have plenty of time). He probably has never read his own culpa reviews, and doesn't realize that he needs to REALLY update his lectures, homeworks, and tests.\r\n\r\nHis tests are ridiculous. No amount of studying can prepare you for them. It's not because you don't know the material, it's because you have to predict the answer that he's looking to hear. Even if you're answer is correct, as the TA agreed with me on several occasions, he could not award points because it was not identical to Pasik's horrible solutions. If you know the material and feel prepared, you can still do poorly because you did not mention something in your answer that was not asked for in the question. You will lose points for not writing a novel for each answer.\r\n\r\nPasik does not hold office hours and does not care about any of his students.

If you skip classes, and you don't already know the material, then you're in trouble.\r\n\r\nWhile I like him as a Professor, he's not the strongest when it comes to math or theory.  He's a pretty practical guy.  That works for him though, especially in data structures, which is a practical course.  His coding skills are very well practiced.  If you want your code to be clear, modular, and work the first time, watch him go through code.  If he posts code online, take it and put it in your coding base.  It's really well written code.\r\n\r\nBy the way, he loves recursion... really loves it.  The main thing I learned from him was how to write concise, elegant, semantically clear, recursive code.\r\n\r\nLittle things to note:\r\n1.  He will not accept anything late.  He assigns things extremely far in advance.  Get them done.\r\n\r\n2.  Make sure you really get the material.  Since he lectures well, the average scores on the tests tend to be pretty high (at least in my experience).  So if you want an A, you need to do well on the tests.\r\n\r\n3.  The tests are really straight-forward (no surprises), but they might require you to actually know what you're doing (not just get the gist).  He will make you write code snippets on the spot on exams.",

                "content": "The best professor I've had at Columbia, hands down. He not only knows his stuff, but is enthusiastic about teaching the material and has an excellent ability to get that knowledge across to students in his lectures. He's extremely organized, always showing up for exams with a detailed plan of exactly what he wanted to do, but never afraid to deviate slightly to answer a student's question. \n(The only exceptions were the two exam review classes, when he stated up front that he would show up with no plan, and spend the time answering whatever questions people had.)\n\nThere was no book for the course, but he walked us through the methods of constructing and traversing data structures, and really worked on explaining the rationale behind the use of different ones. If you come to class and follow what he's going through, you'll be fine. He's always open to answer questions, and will be happy to explain why he does things in certain ways before going on.\n\nJust a note: show up on time for class! This course met at 9:10 on the 7th floor of Hamilton. Yes, I know that feels early, especially for CS majors. Yes, I know it's a pain in the ass to get to the 7th floor of Hamilton without getting to the building at least a few minutes early. Make the effort to do so. Professor Pasik was always in class at least 10-15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin, and was happy to answer questions about the course work, CS in general, or anything else (he's a somewhat experienced scuba diver). He starts class exactly on time by laying out exactly what he's going to cover, and giving infrormation that's really necessary for understanding the rest of the material in that class. Lots of people would then routinely walk in 10, 15, or even 30 minutes late, then wonder why they were having trouble understanding the material.\n\nProfessor Pasik was always available after class to talk with students, and was great about responding to e-mail messages.\n\nThe material in this class is not so intuitive to plenty of people, but it's a lot harder if you don't come to class. For those of us who came to class ontime regularly, it was a lot easier. Pasik doesn't expect you to just copy the data structures from your class notes. He wants you to be able to understand how and why they work, so you can effectively use them. At the beginning of the semester he doesn't expect a full comprehension of all of it, but by the end he really expects people to have picked up on the things he was driving home all semester. The homework assignments follow this trend.\n\nAll in all, a great professor. I'm hoping to have the opportunity to take more classes with him.",

But I didn't expect the professor to show such little commitment to the class. Around the second or third week, he posed the following question to us: \"Does any mind if we don't have class on Thursday, and just have class one day a week?\" No one responded, and this was viewed as consent to literally cut the amount of scheduled class time in half. (I'm not sure how ethical this was, but I didn't want to be the one to complain, and most people just seemed to be in there for the credit.) He claimed we'd cover the same material, but I'm doubtful. I was going to put a complaint about this in my official class review, but it appears we were never given any forms. \n\nAs far as lecturing style, he's pretty straightforward and open to student questions, but it's difficult to discern any passion for the subject matter in his delivery. He doesn't go into much more detail than the slides, and I ended up getting most of what I learned from the book. \n\nHe told us there'd be four quizzes but the first only came about halfway through the term, the second came a couple weeks before the final, and the final two simply didn't come. These quizzes are very unusual in that they're multiple choice, but there is no indication as to how many of the choices are supposed to be circled. And many of the answer selections seem quite borderline, in my opinion. No quizzes or grades of any sort were revealed until the very day of the final exam, which made it very difficult to gauge how much to study. \n\nI was amazed that this class gets you the same credit as the legendary OS class taught by Professor Nieh during the Fall. If you want an easy A in OS, I'd recommend taking this class. But if you want to be challenged, or really learn about the linux kernel, take it with someone else, some time other than the summer. ",

These assignments were very instructive. But there's no need to really do a good job of it, because your grade is determined completely by a two minute demo in which you show him the program running, and explain to him how your code works (professor showed up an hour late to said demo). He never even asked to see certain parts of the assignment that I knew some people didn't have working. The final OS demo was equally cursory. When I complained to him anonymously about his grading method, he claimed his method was more effective than having him and/or the TA go over the code themselves, and that if I had a problem with how mine was graded individually, I should talk to him about that specifically. It was hard to have a problem with \"how mine was graded\" though considering that we were never even told our grades on them."

                "content": "I feel kinda bad writing a harsh review because Papageorgiou is a really nice guy and cares a lot. He's the professor who looks over your shoulder while you're taking the midterm and tells you where you've made a mistake. (This boosted my score by at least 10 points.) He's the professor who absolutely glows when people do well on the homework. When he says his door is open, he _means_ it. Really means it.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not going to shit on him because I don't like him. Or because my grade will probably suck, because that's my fault for losing interest and not doing the work past March or so. I'm going to shit on him because despite what a wonderful person he is, his teaching has thoroughly earned it. Before I launch into that, though, here's my recommendation if you want to learn about quantum computing: read Scott Aaronson's book, \"Quantum Computing Since Democritus\". I bought it and chipped away at it half-heartedly for a few days in February and it taught me more and explained things better than Papageorgiou did in a whole semester.\r\n\r\nOk, now that we've got preliminaries out of the way:\r\n\r\nThe class really is as close to an out-and-out waste of time as I've had at Columbia. Each lecture starts with a 10-30 minute review of the previous lecture (generally closer to 10 minutes, but 30 happened a few times), so you're getting maybe 2/3 of a lecture. And then during that 2/3 of a lecture, the class covers very little material. For a sense of how little: it would be generous to say we covered 1.5 chapters of the textbook during the second half of the semester. And we only managed that by skipping all the tough material and glossing over the particulars of a lot of the easier material.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, this isn't an \"easy\" class the way some with little content are. There's just a lot of time dedicated to intense study of trivia. A personal pet peeve: an inordinate amount of time was spent on how single qubit quantum gates can be decomposed into rotations. The textbook devotes maybe 10 lines to this, tucked away as a side note in the end-of-section exercises of an introductory chapter, but we dedicated many hours in class to example after example of this decomposition. One of the five questions on the final was decomposing a single qubit gate into rotations. And it came up during the final review. And on the quiz before the midterm. Papageorgiou kept coming back to it, guessing his way through the decomposition, explaining how he intuited every step, filling the whiteboard up top to bottom... all for a decomposition that can be solved quickly and directly by the algebraic substitution techniques you learned in middle school.\r\n\r\nWhile that's an extreme case, it's gives a sense of how the class worked and why we got almost nothing done. Papageorgiou can't seem to explain the \"big picture\" -- he drills down into particulars very quickly, and gets lost in them. There are professors who, at the beginning of a lecture, can tell you what you will learn today and what its place is in the course. Papageorgious can only do the former. As a result, at the end of the semester, the material you know is a fair  approximation to what you might know if you lifted 30 random paragraphs out of the first 4 chapters of the textbook and then studied each intensively for an hour. You'd know plenty of factoids but have little grasp of how they fit together. My working hypothesis: Papageorgiou never sat down and worked out a theory of what this class is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nAgain, an example, which I think is representative: a physics major in our class was confused by the proof that sets of quantum gates are universal. He objected that the proof didn't address the efficiency of constructing an arbitrary gate from the universal set. Flustered, Papageorgiou brushed this off, saying roughly \"In quantum computing, we don't care about efficiency!\" That might make sense if there weren't so much fuss about the efficiency of Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The \"big picture\" explanation that was never forthcoming: quantum computing, like the deterministic variety, happened as a progression from proofs of computability (in this case, universality of gates) to proofs of efficient algorithms for specific problems (e.g. Shor) to...\r\n\r\nAh. Another sore point. We never got the next step, \"proofs that quantum computing algorithms form families,\" the quantum complexity classes. The book, which is 15 years old, barely knows quantum complexity classes exist. But they do, and what I've read about them on my own (e.g. Aaronson's book, Wikipedia) is really really cool, and it was very disappointing and frustrating to go through a whole semester and not (as far as I can recall) hear BQP mentioned even once.\r\n\r\nOk, I'm going to stop now because you've probably gotten the point. :P",

But it was not a joke: it covered a reasonable amount of material in a reasonable amount of depth. Papageorgiou is just an effective teacher, and he doesn't assign cruel problem sets.\r\n\r\nThe class covers only the basics of quantum computing. It's a CS class but it would be reasonable for a physics major to take it, if they had some very rudimentary CS knowledge (logic circuits, and the general idea of big-O analysis of runtimes). The fact that it was targeted at two groups limited the material we could cover. We couldn't really talk about complexity theory to avoid alienating the physics majors. And we couldn't talk about any actual quantum mechanics or real-world implementations of quantum computers, because that would have terrified the CS majors.\r\n\r\nYou definitely need to know your linear algebra coming in. The first quarter of the class is basically linear algebra review, to familiarize students with the Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics, and help them get used to working with complex numbers. We then worked through how operations on quantum states can be equivalent to Boolean circuits (proving that quantum computers are at least as powerful as classical computers).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the class was going over the famous quantum algorithms that are better than any known classical algorithm. Shor's factoring algorithm, which is the cool thing that everyone wants to learn, didn't really come in until the last few weeks of class (although much of the groundwork was laid before that).\r\n\r\nLectures were basically the professor working through problems on a digital board and explaining as he went. It was important to take good notes, because for some reason he would not post copies of these digital notes online. His lectures were quite helpful; they followed the general structure of the textbook but made explicit some parts of the book left \"as an exercise to the reader\". Normally I think this format is terrible, but there was something mysterious going on and I actually remembered most of what I learned. Perhaps it was the professor's mellifluous accent.\r\n\r\nThe professor and TA were both helpful and available during office hours. They were also both responsive by email, and generally very friendly in all their interactions.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great class. I didn't have to work that hard and I still learned a ton.

                "content": "Computational Linear Algebra with Papageorgiou is a pretty decent class. He's definitely one of the nicest professors you will meet at Columbia and is a lenient grader to boot. Apart from the actual teaching, this class is great. Linear algebra is a super interesting subject and has applications in every single field. Homework assignments are reasonable - not insanely hard or long. Tests are graded generously and he will tell you if you are right or wrong during an exam.\r\n\r\nThe class is essentially Linear Algebra + algorithms for matrix operations. It follows the standard Linear Algebra book by Strang. Papageorgiou generally starts his class with a 20 minute recap of the previous lecture followed by whizzing through the current material.\r\n\r\nHe has a strong Greek accent which can make class hard sometimes. He is an above average teacher, but his abilities are nothing to brag about. He wants you to understand the material and not monotonously apply formulae you don't understand. However, between his accent and bad handwriting, you can occasionally get lost and fall behind (I got lost twice this class - once during RREFs and another time during eigenvalues and eigenvectors). He sometimes doesn't really explain stuff properly and just says \"Boom! Boom! You're done\" which causes endless frustration. It's important that you go to his office hours and clear up doubts because all the material builds up (which makes studying for the final very interesting because you see how stuff you learned in the beginning of the semester all ties together).\r\n\r\nPapageorgiou makes tests low stress by acting as a check-guard during exams. At any point, you can go up to him and ask him to look over our solution and he will tell you if it's right or wrong. As long as you know the material, you can easily get high grades on tests by making him check the harder problems. He obviously won't tell you the answer, but you will at least know that you're missing something. It's very possible to get perfect scores on every single test in this class as a result of his checks.\r\n\r\nProgramming assignments shouldn't take more than 2-4 hours. Problem sets consist of 5-6 questions from the textbook. If you know the material, they can be finished in 1-2 hours. More often than not, you will have to read the material to solve the problem sets which makes them take more time.\r\n\r\nHe has 4 quizzes which consist of 2-3 problems which keep you up to speed. They count toward your midterm and final scores.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was straight forward. 5 problems - he gave us one of the problems a week before the exam (but it was a hard one) and told us that another problem would be solving a general system of equations. Pay attention to his revision sessions - he reveals the tricks needed to solve some problems on the midterms then.\r\n\r\nFinal was harder than the midterm and he didn't tell us any of the questions before hand. However, it was completely doable, especially since he helped students out during the exam. It also had some cool problems that made you think and appreciate the subject better.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a good class and Papageorgiou makes it as easy as it can be. If you pay attention, do the work and take advantage of Papageorgiou's help, there is no reason you shouldn't get a great grade and learn a lot in the process.",

Especially since the material isn't the most exciting stuff, class can get pretty boring.\r\n\r\nHowever, he really tries to make computational linear algebra accessible to everybody, and he tries to give everybody good grades.  If you ask him to stop and repeat something, he'll do it.  If you're a little confused about something on a quiz or a test, go up and ask him about it.  He's very liberal with hints.\r\n\r\nThere are five homework sets, four quizzes, a midterm, and a final.  The homework sets are part theory (questions from the textbook) and part programming (often to implement algorithms he discusses in class).  None were particularly challenging, except for the one for finding the null space of a particular matrix, and only because there were so many places for hiding potential counting errors.  The quizzes and tests are really, really easy (he called one a \"morale booster\") and are meant to help your midterm/final grades.  The midterm and final are also ridiculously straightforward (he'll even give you two or three of the five questions beforehand).  Oh, and it doesn't hurt that you can ask Prof. Papageorgiou to check your answers for you.  He'll tell you if anything's wrong and the correct way to get the right answer.\r\n\r\nThis course covers a lot of topics, and if you're not interested in linear algebra, you'll find it incredibly tedious.  But at least Prof. Papageorgiou will be there to simplify everything and help you get a nice grade in return for sitting through class.\r\n\r\nThere is one side-effect of getting so much help from the professor, though.  If you want to get an A+ and not just an A, you have to do the four extra credit assignments.  But that's not really much of a side-effect because they're also unbelievably easy.

The professor doesn't assign a homework until all of the material on it is covered, and then you get two weeks to do it, which is generous.  You are not given as much time for extra credit (like a week), but extra credit problems are fairly easy proofs, so it is not too difficult to get all 10% of the extra credit, if you are not too afraid of proofs.\n\nThe midterm was very easy, and the final was significantly harder.  He is a pretty lenient grader, and doesn't plan to fail anyone.\n\nThe textbook is followed pretty closely, and packets are made covering a few algorithms not covered in the book.\n\nWhile nobody's crazy about his teaching abilities, he is a very nice guy who will help you out if you ask him.",

He throws a joke into lecture when he can, and come on, the South Park stuff was totally funny and appreciated by all.  This image and corresponding line from South Park is pretty much Alex's trademark, and anyone who has taken that class will remember it: http://blogmeisterusa.mu.nu/archives/CartmanAuthoritah-thumb.jpg\n\nYeah. That's what you will be using for your study of images in Matlab.  And he uses a recording of that \"You will respect my Authoritah!\" line for the study of sounds in Matlab.  I actually retained some of this stuff.  I wish that all Compsci classes were actually taught in a computer lab.\n\nAlex is able to teach in a clear-cut manner, but unfortunately this is Gateway and you will probably be half-asleep simply because it's a 3-hour long class.

It is a topics course on approximation algorithms, mostly for NP-Complete optimization problems, and there is a brief discussion of online approximation algorithms at the end of the course.  The emphasis is on the design and analysis of approximation algorithms, and some time is also spent on hardness of approximation results.  This is a definitely great class to take if you enjoyed Analysis of Algorithms 1.\r\n\r\nProfessor Yannakakis is an excellent instructor who has an unbelievable command of the material. He always has comes to class with a very well-structured lecture plan, and is able to give very thorough answers to students\u2019 questions.  He also posts great lecture notes online, which are very helpful, as is the recommended textbook \u201cApproximation Algorithms\u201d by Vazirani.  For many of the lectures, he begins the lecture by introducing an optimization problem (or a family of closely related optimization problems) and then spends the lectures going through different approximation algorithms for the problem in increasing order of sophistication.  The class met once a week for two hours, and while these lectures were a bit long, it allowed for the material to be covered with a good amount of depth.  He is also very up to date with the material and able to put the results we cover in context, sometimes telling us about recent improvements from the past few months!  While some of the reviewers have correctly point out that he is not the most exciting lecturer, he does a great job of engaging students in lectures.  He is definitely one of the best professors I have had, and I believe he is by far the most underrated CS professor.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were some of the most interesting and well-designed that I have seen.  They are very relevant to the material that is covered in lecture and strike a great balance between rigor and accessibility.  Every problem is interesting and somewhat substantial and there are no boring filler problems.  I definitely had a great time working on these, though I suspect it would have been much less enjoyable had I left them till the last minute.  We were given a good amount of time for each problem set and I recommend taking advantage of that.  For the last month of the class we had a research paper instead of problem sets, which required to write a 10-15 page paper on a relevant topic of our interest.  The assignment is pretty flexible and I thought it was a great experience, especially since none of my other CS classes had a similar assignment.",

The course covers approximation algorithms often touching upon some state of the art stuff in the field. It's quite an intellectually challenging with plenty of opportunity to really dive in depth into the subject matter if you choose. There were a surprising number of undergrads (at least 6 out of 35) for a 6000 level class so you'll have plenty of company.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is not the most exciting lecturer but an expert in the field and as such can answer any question you throw at him. The class was 2 hours long so it was often hard to concentrate for the entire duration. If you get lost at any one point in time, you're pretty much screwed for the rest of the class since it all builds up.\r\n\r\nEach class generally consisted of us studying a specific problem and different techniques to design approximation algorithms. A lot of the material can be found in the textbook Approximation Algorithms by Vazirani. It would be useful to brush up on common problems like max-cut, flows, TSP, etc. to get the most out of the class.\r\n\r\nHomeworks were generally difficult and required some time and deep thinking. I worked with a friend and it took us maybe 10-15 hours on average + attending office hours where one of the TAs would pretty much go over the gist of the solution (which was very much appreciated). \r\n\r\nYou have to write a 15 page research paper on any topic of your choice within the scope of the class. He gives you a month for it and I suggest you start early. I put together a pathetic excuse for a paper 3 days before it was due and was not happy with the results or my understanding of the problem I was studying.\r\n\r\nOverall, a solid class that's only offered once every 2 years. 100% recommend taking it.",

He posts great lecture notes, gives interesting homework and has TAs who grade fairly.

This was my second class with him, the first being CS Theory in the fall, and with that said, I am confident that he is a good choice for any class he is teaching.  I will definitely take another class with him if the opportunity comes up.\r\n\r\nWhile he might not be a dazzling speaker, he is always well-prepared with very structured lecture plans and does a great job presenting the material.  The material is very well-motivated and he involves the class in his lectures by frequently asking questions.  He is able to thoroughly answer any question that comes up from the class.  There are few to no errors in the lectures, and detailed lecture notes are posted on Courseworks.  The textbook is the bible for the subject and it is well-written, but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strictly follow it, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not necessary for the course.  \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were also very well-written and unambiguous, and ultimately at the heart of the course.  I definitely learned a lot from working through them.  While this class is the natural follow-up to CS theory, one difference is that there are fewer formulaic problems that simply require following an algorithm.  Usually a bit of thought is required for most of the homework problems, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re manageable as long as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave them until the last minute.

                "content": "This was an OK class. CS Theory with Yannakakis is neither good nor bad. The subject itself is very interesting. It's just the presentation of the material by Yannakakis and the textbook (HMU) that is lacking.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is no doubt a brilliant man, but he's a mediocre teacher. He puts up slides of lecture notes on Courseworks and teaches directly off of them in class. This led to maybe 30 out of 87 students actually attending the class.\r\n\r\nThe textbook often has convoluted proofs and too few examples. It's the defacto textbook for automate theory, but I think it could be improved. Sipser is another book which has slightly better explanations.\r\n\r\nYannakakis teaches concepts in a reasonable manner given the dense material. Most people didn't attend class and just studied from the slides and textbook. His explanations are not much better than the textbook and you can learn everything from his slides.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to make sure you are up to speed with what's being covered in class. The material can be dense and hard to follow, so try not to get lost because it will lead to a disaster when exams come around.\r\n\r\nProblem sets (40% of grade) generally have 1 or 2 easy questions and the rest are hard. It is advisable to check your work with classmates since homework counts for 40% of your grade and you shouldn't lose too many points on it.\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much if you don't completely understand some complicated proofs (eg- NFA to Regex, PDA to CFG conversions). If you know the method that it proves, you'll be fine for exams. He never asked to prove something in an exam. Questions were along the lines of design a DFA, CFG, Turing machine, algorithm, do a reduction, etc. Some of them can be tricky.\r\n\r\nThe midterm (30%) and final (30%) consisted of 6 and 5 questions respectively and were both in class. They were manageable, but kind of hard since we got so little practice solving problems. The course is mostly theory with few examples and 4 problems per homework don't really prepare you for the tests. Make sure to study all the lecture slides and problem sets for exams. Read the textbook whenever you get confused by the lecture slides.\r\n\r\nGrading is fair. TAs grade both problem sets and exams. Final letter grades were also very reasonable.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't avoid Yannakakis, but neither would I recommend taking this class if someone better (like Aho or Malkin) were teaching it the next semester.",

                "content": "CS Theory as taught by Yannakakis is a good class -- it achieves everything you basically expect a class to, though it isn't outstanding in any particular regard. \r\n\r\nFor almost the entire semester Yannakakis follows the textbook (\"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation\"), and it pays to read the text ahead of time. The book is light on theory and heavy on examples, and you could probably get away with not going to class for the first 10 weeks or so until Turing Machine reductions start to be explained, because the book's explanations until then are always thorough enough. Lecture clarifies and sometimes expands a bit on the book, but not in any fundamental way, e.g. there might be a slower and a faster way to implement a given algorithm, and the book gives the slower one while Yannakakis will show the faster one in class. Once you get into Turing Machines, going to lecture is pretty important. The book sucks on reductions.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer Yannakakis isn't exciting (it didn't help that this semester's room was poorly lit and had amphitheater style seating -- quite conducive to dozing off) but he is usually quite effective at going through examples clearly. He's been doing this for long enough to know which points people get confused about, and he makes sure to hammer those home. The only times I was truly lost in class were on a handful of particularly weird proofs that he demonstrated purely to make a point; they never came up on homework or exams.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is (as those of you who've Googled him will know), a pretty big name in the field with a prize or two to his name. There aren't many opportunities in CS Theory for him to show off his brilliance, but he is clearly in total command of the material in a way that not all professors always are. He virtually never makes mistakes on the blackboard (he's usually working from his lecture slides, which are excellent and available on CourseWorks), and will occasionally respond to a seemingly narrow question by tying it to much broader questions and answering those, too.",

Gradiance allows unlimited retakes, which is pretty neat, though you have to wait 10 minutes between attempts. If you have a lot of time to burn, you can just retake Gradiance often enough to solve all the questions by process of elimination (there's a fairly small pool of answers, so after about 90 minutes you've seen them all)."

I've always marveled at why I seem to enjoy classes taught by graduate students better than I do classes taught by actual professors, but I think it is because graduate students are more understanding of how to lead a class of undergrads in such a way that they will be interested and entertained.\n\nDavid Elson has two qualities that really qualify him as an excellent teacher, 1) excellent English and ability to explain concepts and 2) a wicked sense of humor.\n\nI have never missed a Data Structures class because of this; this was true of Chris Murphy's 1004 class I took last semester, too. David Elson really CARED that the students are learning the material -- he explains things clearly, does relevant examples, cracks corny jokes, and always tries to encourage class participation (a noble endeavor indeed!). His availability is also extremely flexible -- he answers emails even at excruciating times like 2 AM on a Friday or Saturday night, which really helps for the people who chronically try to complete hw assignments two days before the due date. The homework assignments started out rather tedious and long, but David took into account the class's complaints / suggestions and lessened the workload to really help us learn the implementations of data structures instead of spending 40 hours struggling with other irrelevant code. I love his programming assignments -- thought they were totally relevant and even FUN, dare I say. This is one of the few classes I ENJOY doing work for.\n\nAll in all, I thought Data Structures would be the death of me this semester, but I ended up loving it and learning far more than I thought I would.

It wasn't until midway through the semester that it was clarified that this was by design and that Steve's philosophy is that in the real world there is ambiguity, so programmers will be expected to apply their own judgment in assumptions when writing a program.  Having worked in cyber security, I don't totally agree... but that being said, it's good to know upfront that you have a lot of latitude in defining the requirements so long as you document your decisions in your readme.\r\n\r\nThe assignments themselves were time consuming, although not necessarily hard.  The thought process is different than most other programming classes: you can't merely write a program to fulfill an outcome, and have to consider how the program can be exploited by attackers.  Your goal in writing is to consider the flaws and add robustness to reduce exploit vectors.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were open notes/open book and scenario based, so it wasn't a matter of regurgitating material as you had to consider circumstances and apply what was covered in lecture.  More CS courses should adopt this format.    \r\n\r\nThe lectures were fantastic, and kept pace with real world developments in security.  The class was at a particularly interesting time late in the 2016 election season when there was a lot of pub about Hillary Clinton's E-mail server and the hacking of the DNC E-mails.  Steve's experience dates back decades and he has a lot of interesting stories which compelled me to research further on my own after class.  \r\n\r\n",

There were several instances when instructions had to be clarified at the last minute before something was due or the rubric itself was incorrect and the grade assigned needed to be revised. \r\n\r\nA fourth homework was assigned during the week of final exams which should have been announced earlier or released during the semester.

Professor Bellovin's lectures are entertaining -- I actually looked forward to going to the lectures. His lectures are obviously well prepared; he seems to reuse the same slides but updates them the night before to keep them relevant. The lectures are organized and lively -- with a nice touch of sarcasm. \r\n\r\nThe assignments are mostly about building a secure program that manages files. Watch out -- just because you \"meet the specs\" doesn't mean you will get full credit (or even a good grade). Unlike other classes where the professor would promise \"you can assume you will get proper input,\" here you can assume the graders will be very creative about how they can cause your program to produce errors. You have to validate inputs like crazy. Writing the actual program isn't hard, but you will use some unusual/unfamiliar c libraries so don't start too late because you need a day or two to familiarize yourself with the documentation. Definitely do assignment 0 to get your C/C++ up to scratch (and you WILL need it for assignment 1). If you start a week early on pretty much any assignment, it will be a breeze. If you start 2-3 days before the deadline, you will be pulling consecutive late-nighters. The assignments aren't cakewalk, but they aren't complicated or ambitious either.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final are subjective (and easy), but graded fairly. They accept a lot of answers if the justification is good. They are still published on earlier versions of the course website if you want to have an idea of what they are like. If you know the lectures, can mix the concepts together, and can \"think like a bad guy\" you will do well on the midterms with little studying. If you pay attention in lecture and go over the slides, you will do well on the test. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a really solid course, interesting, and not burdensome. I recommend it.\r\n",

He's got a good sense of humor, he can draw you in to the material, and when he does he explains it very clearly.  Of course, the material is intrinsically interesting, varied and with a strong focus on real-world security incidents.\n\nI'd recommend the course, but there are some caveats.  There's no single textbook and the readings, while usually interesting, vary greatly in terms of how thoroughly they cover their subjects.  On top of that, while lecture notes are posted online, they usually provide only a broad outline of what Bellovin says in class, so it can be hard to find reference material for homeworks or for studying if you missed a class or didn't take good notes.\n\nAlso, Bellovin appears to be something of a big shot in the computer security world outside of academia (eg., helped write Usenet back in the day, won the 2007 NIST / NASA security award).  This is kind of cool, but involves him missing a relatively large number of classes to travel to conferences and so on.  When he's gone, classes are taught by the TA, and at least in our case, the TA was a non-native English speaker and a bad lecturer.",

Everything related to obect orientation in java and classes/objects is kind of rushed as well as arrays and that makes the midterm a little harder, so I would reccomend reading/working ahead to the sections up until arrays so that there's more time to process some of this. Homeworks 6 and 8 are the hardest but if you spend the time doing them the rest of this class will make sense and become a lot easier. Really the key is learning how to debug and understanding objet orientation in java as well as how java as a laguage functions. If you do the harder homeworks well the other concepts will be relatively easy because they just build on the basics. Also the last portion of this class helps to prepare you for data structures so it actually is relatively important as well. There are really great office hours for this class, and I really enjoyed this class in the end. I found professor Blaer to be very good overall, but some of the concepts he really doesn't go into depth on so I would do the readings before class.

Lowest even and lowest odd numbered HW assignment grade is also dropped (very appreciated, given that I couldn't turn 2 assignments in even by the late deadline).

Its more like he codes and talks. Honestly, I did not find it helpful to go to lecture because of this. I found it a better use of my time to just learn Java on my own. \n\nThe homeworks do progressively get harder and more time consuming, so my advice is to start early and go to TA OH. Some TAs are better than others imo cuz some of them would not even know what the assignment is about while others were more prepared to answer questions, so find out which TAs work better for you. Also, check EDStem while doing HW, because often the HW instructions are not very specific and there will be new requirements that are not mentioned in the HW instructions that you only find out about because someone else asked about it on ED Stem.\n\nI do like that Blaer tells you what topics are going to be on the exam before hand so that you know what to really drill down for the exam. I only went to Blaer's OH one time, and he was lowkey condescending. I asked my question in a respectful manner so I think the rudeness was uncalled for.  If many people are saying hes unapproachable then I doubt this was just a one time thing. \n\nGrading for this class is chill though, its curved well. I ended up with an A w a raw of 92. Class average was like a 70 for the final and midterm. ",

I would only take this course if you are seriously interested in majoring/minoring in CS - it is not just an elective you can push off to the side. I took COMS1004 to see if I wanted to major in CS and realized it wasn't for me, so the last couple of months were a pain to get through because the homework gets harder and harder. Honesty, everything after the midterm dramatically increased in difficulty. I also found the homework to be inordinately difficult compared to the exams. Expect to spend 5-10 hours on each homework, probably more on the Poker assignment. \n\nBlaer is a very charismatic and enjoyable lecturer. However, if you are someone who doesn't know what is going on, it's easy to get confused because he incorporates jargon that we learned in class into his explanations. If you don't understand a previous concept, MAKE SURE you figure it out asap.\n\nAs someone who got an A and was incredibly confused half of the semester, my best advice is to 1) Start HW early and go to office hours for help. There are lots of TAs so I'd suggest going to different ones and figuring out which TAs you like; 2) Actually read the Zybooks and make sure you know how to do all of the problems. For greater understanding, do the challenge problems; 3) Go to the review sessions and study everything he says for the midterm/final. I found YouTube and previous lectures/HWs to be helpful. Final and midterm are similarly structured, and if you're confused start with memorizing the syntax of the algorithms he covers (binary search, linear search, max/min, selection/insertion sort).\n\nI took ESP and that was a super chill, surface-level introduction to CS concepts.",

Just open a personal Codio Project and type with him as he codes on his computer. Coding > taking notes and you will do well on the exam. When it comes to exams Prof Blaer does half the work for you already. He lists out all that you need to know in a txt file.

He is not bad at explaining concepts, but there are no slides or complementary notes for most coding lectures and therefore the learning process feels unstructured. The strategy is to make your own notes with the recordings after class, because it's hard to make a structured notes in class when you don't know where he's going. I however did not realize this early on and did not make my own notes. So although I ended up an A I feel like I did not have a clear picture of what I have learned.\nIt's a bit ironic because the logistics stuff in this class are pretty structured and organized in my opinion.\n\nI personally did not encounter any difficulties in seeking support, so I disagree with other comments saying he is unapproachable.",

I can't even begin to imagine what this course would have been like for someone who knew absolutely no code. (If you have time, I would recommend watching intro to Java videos on YouTube to get preliminary exposure to the content!) The assignments were hard, I'm not gonna lie. Especially the programming ones. For the biggest assignments I probably spent close to 15 hours/week on them, and still wasn't able to get a perfect score. When it comes to TA's, you just have to find the good ones. Some of them simply don't show up or don't know what they are doing, and some of them are better then Blaer tbh. Also, ALWAYS REQUEST REGRADES!!! I can't even count the amount of times TA's messed up my grade, even on the Midterm. When in doubt, just send a regrade request. \n\nBlaer is a fun prof. He tells fun stories and will go over concepts again for better understanding. Sometimes he glosses over things that are actually important though, so I would recommend re-watching parts of lectures closer to the exams to make you studied everything.\n\n",

Blaer does a good job of going through and explaining the overall general concepts of DS but I found him to digress into off topic subjects this semester, which made the learning tougher for me. I did not enjoy how he taught us how to code using DS algorithms by just perusing through the textbook code. It would have been nice if had done live coding of DS algorithms in example coding like he did in Intro to Java, because when it came to completing the homeworks, I understood the concepts but barely know how to code such concepts from scratch. His grading policy is very consistent, which I appreciate. The midterm was more difficult than what I expected. Even though he said what was going to be on the midterm, I found the questions to be more complex than I thought. There were a lot of tree questions, even though he had taught it the week prior without giving us time to absorb how trees work through homework.

A lot of times I had knowledge of the topic behind explained, but sat there and saw him explain it for the first time and thought that if this was my first time being exposed to what he is saying, I wouldn't have grasped the material. Honestly, a very frustrating experience. Also the book is terrible; the code is filled with a lot bugs. Skip class and learn the material on your own. Also use problems sets from other universities to actually learn data structures. If you are doing the problem sets being assigned and think they are easy, that is because you are not learning actual data structures, just a bunch of disconnected programs.

As a professor of a large lecture class, those two qualities are heightened: his jokes (though repetitive) can be stress-relieving, and if you have a background in java, his explanations are intriguing. However, if you don't have a background in java, Blaer is not very good at explaining simple concepts. He over-explains, confuses students, and gets distracted easily. I personally felt that my time was better spent on learning java online than learning in his class.\r\n\r\nOne specific moment that comes to mind is Blaer's introduction to stacks. He went on an hour-long description of the intricacies of a stack, over-explaining it, when in all honesty it's a somewhat-simple java topic. All he really needed to say was \"this is like a list, but instead of being able to access any node at any time, stacks follow the process of last-in first-out, like a tissue box or a pile of books.\"\r\n\r\nTo be fair to Blaer, he is an incredibly nice professor who has the difficult job of teaching nearly 450 students in one large lecture class. I'm not sure anyone would have been able to do as good a job as online learning, especially in a class on Computer Science. \r\n\r\nMy advice: take his class, but don't expect it to be great. Enjoy the comedic, positive side of Blaer, and deal with the negative sides of the class by learning online or reading the textbook.",

He is also incredibly nice & just a really genuine, down to earth person. \r\n\r\nAs for the class itself: I loved it as well & was definitely one of my favorite classes at Columbia so far. I had actually not done any programming in Java for a few years, because I had taken AP CS in high school & skipped 1004, so it took me a bit of time to adjust and remember/relearn some things. The class was definitely challenging, but not too much and in a good way I think. I really learned a lot from the class & fell in love with CS again (I wasn't a CS major going into the class, but I am now). \r\n\r\nThe TAs were also super super helpful & I highly recommend going to office hours to work on the assignments/study for tests (it's so much harder on your own trust me), and there are so many TAs so there are office hours like literally all the time which is so nice. \r\n\r\nThis class is required for the CS major & minor, but I'd honestly recommend taking it even if you aren't majoring/minoring in CS. I would also highly recommend taking it when Blaer is teaching,if possible (he's like 1000x better than the other profs who teach it).",

The book is very useful, office hours are a big help, there are many resources online, and other students can be helpful with the homeworks if you don't know where to start.  Blaer is a great professor - entertaining, funny, and makes things very clear even when they're difficult concepts to grasp.  Having taken 1004 and 3134 with him, I'm sad to not have him as a professor next semester.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you read the book and get help early if you think you might need it - the concepts you'll learn build on each other so it's important to not get lost or it will take a while to get back on track (same with all CS courses, IMO).  If you're new to CS, expect a struggle in the beginning since the most basic concepts are covered pretty quickly, but it will get easier for sure.\r\n\r\nGet started on the homework as early as you can and things will go well!",

It's really important and useful that you read the book. Going to recitation doesn't make that much of a difference, unless you want to ask a question.

There are a lot of TAs, and they're for the most part helpful. Recitation is usually staged more of an OH though, they take questions & don't really have a set plan. You must go to the first recitation--that's when they go through how to set up pico so you can actually code, and it's a million times easier seeing them do it in front of you than trying to read the tutorial.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me and go into the class w/o knowing any compsci, you're going to spend the first few classes going \"what the FUCK is going on.\" Be good about reviewing notes and reading the textbook though (and doing a lot of googling), and eventually you'll catch up.\r\n\r\nBefore each exam he'll usually go over what will be tested. Make sure to go to at least one of the TA's review sessions--they'll usually cover something a little more comprehensively than Blaer. Exams are decent. Often I just read & reread the textbook and that was enough. The final covered way more content, but to make up for it it was also easier. \r\n\r\nAlso, use Piazza religiously. Questions are almost immediately answered and any question you might have will probably already be up there.\r\n\r\nAn A is definitely doable, no matter your past experience; you're going to have to put in some work & effort though.",

If this is your very first exposure to computer science, be forewarned that this is a challenging class. It will be much more rigorous than most likely any other introductory course in other fields. That being said, if you put in the effort, this class is very doable. You will be spending hours studying, as it requires learning both a language (java) and a general science (CS theory). If you do you not intend to be a computer science major, I would suggest taking a different course that involves coding (like a applications course that teaches Python with another subject, or a coding course for nonmajors). If you do take this course, be prepared to do a lot of googling & research on your own to figure out how Java works. It would really help you to do some basic tutorials to get the gist of it before you head into the first lecture. \r\n\r\nBlaer is an excellent professor, and his explanatory style is very clear and concise. He gets very distracted in his lectures, and it's pretty hilarious and adorable--which always made them a pleasure to attend. His expectations for tests and homeworks are always very clear. He does, however, have a tendency to underemphasize how difficult/important topics will be. For example, when listing topics to go over on test, if he mentions something in passing, you should know it pretty much backwards and forwards. Another example, the second to last homework we used a hashmaps, FileReaders, and PrinterWriters--all of which he probably talked about for like two seconds and never explained. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TAs are beautiful, wonderful human beings. James Lin the head TA/(and I quote) \"aspiring Little League Coach\" is the best thing to happen to 1004 probably ever, and he was very encouraging and generally super kind in all his emails and communications. They are all very helpful, just be sure to find one who you get along with and remember their office hours (there are like a 11 TAs, and like always office hours). Piazza is also a great resource, with under 15 min response times. Usually all of my questions were already answered there before I even needed to ask anyone. ",

I honestly don't understand why some people chose not to attend this class because I found the book to be average at explaining concepts, while I found Professor Blaer to be exceptional at explaining the material. I rarely referred to the book after his lectures because I either understood the material from his lecture, or was able to understand is after digesting my notes. I think this is a sign of a great teacher. \r\n\r\nEven in a 200+ person class, Blaer was able to captivate the room with his large voice and abundant personality. In addition, he managed to encourage student participation, which kept the class interactive and engaging. In addition, occasionally, Professor Blaer would drive home the importance of a particular concept with a story about his research, which usually involved a hilarious and catastrophic ending involving multi-ton robots ramming into buildings or almost running people over. \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer's exams are fairly straightforward and he essentially tells you about 50% of the exam, so these are fairly low stress endeavors. I found the final harder than the midterm, but still fairly straightforward. Not much to worry about here. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint with Professor Blaer is an organizational complaint. He would usually claim he would post the HW by a certain date and note post it till 3 or 4 days afterwards. He also granted classwide extensions in unecesarry situations which made the last HW assigned and due during reading week, which was poor planning on his part. Lastly, I feel that the first 15 minutes of class, where students as clarification questions on the HW, is a waste of time. If he wrote his questions in a less ambiguous manner, and used this class time to teach more material, that would be more efficient. Apart from those organization things, I can't complain about this professor. I would recommend his class to anyone in a heartbeat. ",

Also he uploads the things he ran in Matlab at the end of lecture so you see what you kinda covered during the lecture. Definitely go to class. \r\n\r\nNo textbook required: i managed without it. You can also find a lot of the things on the Matlab website. \r\n\r\nWorkload: He has 6 problem sets and drops one. You should not wait until the day before its due because some will take a bit of time. Start early and do a little each day and workload isn't bad at all. Also, he often extends the due date for things which is always a plus for you procrastinators but don't try to rely on that. \r\n\r\nExams: He reviews what will be on it and reviews the exam after. \r\n\r\nExams go for \"breadth rather than depth.\" Exams weren't too difficult at all. You shouldn't have an awful time. He's also quite friendly and approachable. I found he answers emails in an appropriate amount of time. \r\n\r\nOverall I recommend this professor! ",

For SEAS and particularly BME students who are required to take this class, having the background in MATLAB from AoE is pretty useful and allows you to slide through the first couple of weeks easily. However, as the class progresses you start discussing Big O notation, structs, object oriented programming, functions like varargin and varargout, and recursion, which were not mentioned in AoE but are really useful to know and require some more time. Later in the course when Blaer talks about histogramming images, you can again use some of the code you wrote in AoE in the homework for this class. Anyway, Blaer is a great professor. He's easily approachable immediately after class or in his office hours. Blaer holds review sessions before the midterm and final, which are really helpful. He tells you what he's going to test over, explains challenging concepts, and in some cases tells you the exact questions. The best advice I can give is to go to class, because Blaer's teaching really clarifies the concepts asked about in the homework. Often you will be able to modify code he wrote in class to solve homework problems. Furthermore, nobody usually goes to TA office hours, but they're really helpful if you're having trouble with a particular problem on the homework, even if you have to go to the crowded Comp. Sci. lounge to utilize them. \r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n*You don't need the textbook for this class. Just take good class notes or get them from someone else. Blaer also posts all the code he writes on his website. \r\n*Also, you don't need any calculus for this course, but any coding experience will help.\r\n*Just go to class. It makes everything easier... Blaer always asks if people have questions at the beginning of class.\r\n*Blaer also tells funny stories about things like cat whiskers and building robots, another reason to attend class.",

However, given the finite probability that computer science continues to show the lack of judgment that they showed in allowing him to teach COMS 1007 this past summer, I feel justified in writing this review.\r\n\r\nI just got reminded this morning that I took COMS 1007 with Professor Blaer this past summer when I got an email that my grade arrived.  The date of the final exam was Thursday August 9th.  I had been checking Courseworks weekly since the end of the course, and this is the first time that I saw the grades posted for assignments 3-4.  I am currently enrolled in COMS 3137 and have completed the first two assignments prior to receiving my grades for the last two assignments and my final grade from COMS 1007.  There is still no grade posted on Courseworks for the final exam, and given that combined with the discrepancy between how well I did in the course and how poorly I felt I did on the final, I'm wondering if he even graded and/or counted the final exam.  This might sound like an outlandish accusation, but the classmates who I've talked to are  all speculating the same idea.  \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer told us during the final lecture, on Tuesday August 7th, that he was setting the following Monday as the grading deadline for the TAs, and therefore that we should expect to know our final grades by the Tuesday of that week.  We were never contacted with notification of any delay.  At first I thought it was just me when my grade wasn't posted all summer, but then I got to COMS 3137 and found that several of my classmates who were in the summer class had not received their grades either, and we all had contacted him several times via email, telephone, and direct office visits.  Professor Blaer didn't respond to most of the emails or telephone calls, and he wasn't in his office when most people arrived.  However, whenever one of us did hear from him, he said that the grades would be up \"by the end of the day.\"  \r\n\r\nThe lack of feedback and organization in this class was representative of the fact that the concern for students' learning was absent, which is a shame.  After all, isn't that the point of any class?  Professor Blaer's lectures were fine.  They weren't amazing, but they were fine.  However, in teaching a class in computer science, organization and feedback are at least as important as the lectures.  I'm my personal opinion, they're far more important because most of the true learning comes from working through and receiving feedback on assignments. ",

                "content": "I honestly wanted to like this class, and expected to after reading several positive reviews.  Maybe there is an inherent flaw in teaching a class like this during the summer, but I suspect that the fatal flaw of this class was that it wasn't well planned.  Nonetheless, as I read the other reviews of Professor Blaer, I am suspecting that he might be better at implementing a course during the fall or spring than during the summer.  \r\n\r\nIt seemed that this entire class was planned as an afterthought, and the class seemed to operate under principles that I previously thought violated those of learning computer science.  I thought computer science was about thoroughly understanding concepts and creatively applying them to solving problems.  I also thought that lectures were a supplementary feature to the learning process, and that the most important part of the learning came when working through assignments.  Finally, I was under the impression that computer science is a subject one couldn't cram for, and the way to learn is through practice.  I'm hoping that I was right about all this, and that the only reason I am questioning it now is due to the faulty implementation of this course.\r\n\r\nI went into this class with the expectation exams should be doable if one is able to figure out the homework assignments on your own.  After all, the purpose of said exams are to ensure that people truly understand the material and don't get rewarded with a top grade for getting through the assignments without fully understanding them (for example, by getting excessive TA help or copying from other students).  However, that really wasn't the case in this course.  The exams tested concepts and syntax that were not covered in the assignments, or that were covered in assignments that weren't assigned until after the exam.  (For example, the first time we were ever asked to write a program using anonymous classes was during the midterm exam.  These is nothing inherently difficult about using anonymous classes in Java, as it is just a quirky syntax to get used to.  However, this straightforward exam problem was significantly more challenging due to the fact that we had never been asked to implement an anonymous class on the computer prior to the exam.)  To be fair, he did teach the concepts in lecture, but it is very difficult (for most people) to learn computer science enough to quickly apply it exclusively through lectures.  \r\n\r\nAnother expectation I had in taking a computer science class over the summer was that I'd be drinking from the fire hose.  I thought I'd be working hard and losing sleep to finish assignments on time.  The only time I truly found myself working hard and losing sleep to get the task done in the time allotted was when cramming for exams.  \r\n\r\nThere were only four homework assignments, each of which consisted of a written portion and a programming portion.  The content of these assignments was fair.  They were time consuming (except for the first one), but completely reasonable in scope.  Nothing we were required to do went beyond the concepts discussed in class, yet I still found myself learning a good deal while working through these assignments.  That being said, I would've liked another assignment or two in order to thoroughly learn the material that was covered on exams but not on the projects, as well as to lessen the weight of each assignment on our grade.  Moreover, he extended the deadline for every assignment, which was great for the students who procrastinated.  However, for those of us who started the assignments when they were released, these extensions were more of a punishment because they were often granted after we had already allocated significant time to completing the assignment prior to the original deadline.  Further, he did not make the new assignment available until the extended due date of the previous one (despite promising to make them available earlier on a few occasions).  Due to the poor timing of assignments, the final assignments ended up being due the midnight prior to the final exam.  \r\n\r\nFeedback was another story.  Initially there was a single grader for the class, and as a result we did not receive feedback on the first homework assignment until the middle of the fourth week of class.  At that point, a new grader was hired.  The class ended last night and we have currently received feedback on two of our four homework assignments.  It also took two weeks to hand back the midterm exam in class.  To be fair, the instructor admitted that the lack of TA help was a problem the course was facing.  However, these delays were more than just annoying: they caused many students to be penalized multiple times for the same mistake.\r\n\r\nLectures largely consisted of presentation of the textbook author's slides, from the book \"Object-Oriented Design and Patterns\" by Cay Horstmann, and occasionally he'd present additional examples of his own.  These lectures were fine, but not exactly easy to pay attention to for three hours.  Easy or not, paying attention was important, as many points he made during lecture had a tendency to show up on exams despite not appearing in the assignments nor being emphasized in the textbook.  When the instructor presented his own code, there was often a several day delay between the presentation of the code and the uploading of this code to the course website, which made at least one of the assignments much more difficult than it needed to be.  \r\n\r\nIf you are planning to take this offering in the future, make sure you are very confident in your ability to learn computer science quickly and without much practice.  Otherwise, you will probably be sensitive to the problems with the course.\r\n\r\n",

                "content": "Paul Blaer is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. His ability to clearly present course material and actually make you learn something is unparalleled. His lectures are very straightforward and well-paced. He will essentially analyze and go through each data structure/algorithm step-by-step, making sure the class is with him as he goes along. He's also a pretty funny guy and will sometimes go on tangents, but they were always CS-related and will be interesting and beneficial to you if you are a CS major (i.e., go to lecture! You don't know what you'll miss). He is a very accessible guy and friendly one-on-one, so although he's intimidating at first, don't be afraid to go to office hours or ask questions in class. A misguided reviewer for this course will have you believe that taking AP Computer Science AB will make this course a breeze. This is NOT the case. I have taken the AB course and I still learned a wealth of information from Blaer, not to mention that most of the material after the midterm was not covered in AB, including perhaps the most important topic, graph theory.\r\n\r\nEach homework assignment is divided into two parts: theory and programming. People I know in this class complained about the GUI. Yes, there is a lot of GUI, so be prepared--in fact, I'd say the GUI is about 50% of each programming assignment, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it probably builds character or something. However, they tend to be fairly simple, such as drawing dots on a grid or drawing binary trees (protip: if you abstract your first tree GUI interface well enough, you can reuse it later on for at least one more assignment). However, there is just as much theory as there is GUI, and the theory is much more challenging than simply looking up how a JComponent works. Most theory questions are taken from the book and definitely require a bit of thought before you arrive at a solution. \r\n\r\nOverall, if you have the option of taking this course with Blaer, don't wait. Take it with him. You'll learn data structures, you'll learn algorithms, you'll probably write some painful GUI code that you don't want to, but you'll come away a better computer science student. ",

Overall, a terrible experience that I'm glad I'm over with. \r\n\r\nProf. Blaer, in his lecturing ability, isn't to blame for why I hated this class so much. He's very clear in explaining the material and a funny guy overall. He was able to keep me awake even after I pulled an all-nighter working on the first assignment (see below).\r\n\r\nThe material is too sparse to deserve an entire semester. For anyone who has taken AP Computer Science AB (not me, and for future CULPA readers, I guess not you, either), the actual data structures covered would already be second-nature, and the associated algorithms would be simple. I stopped going to lectures really early on in the semester since each week covered only roughly five pages of the textbook. \r\n\r\nThe homeworks were absolutely ridiculous. Most of the programming in the homework assignments didn't involve implementing the data structures (instead, we were just allowed to steal the source code from the textbook's website), but instead revolved around Java GUIs. All but one of the assignments had uninteresting programs for us to code (unsurprisingly, that exception was the one that involved the least fiddling around with GUIs) and in general took quite awhile of experimentation. Furthermore, the TAs were incredibly slow at grading the assignments. The 60-odd people's assignments were divided among four TAs (the remaining TA was solely recitation instructor) but would take somewhere between 3-4 weeks to get back to you. Of course, you could just say, \"oh, each assignment takes a long time to grade,\" but the fact that they managed to grade all the exams within six hours after the midterm demonstrates that they can grade quickly, but simply choose not to. \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, code didn't have to be as strictly formatted and documented as it did in 1007... and... I'm done with this course! (and I pity all you future CS majors that have to take this class)",

If you've never taken comp sci before then find yourself a study/homework buddy in either your class or as an upperclassmen who has taken matlab before. Go to lecture. Get used to the idea of spending hours at a time in the computer lab (bring a sweatshirt, it gets cold in mudd). If you get to a point in the homework where you just can't handle it anymore, it's ok to just turn it in (especially if it's past 3am). Ask for help if you've sat in front of the computer for more than an hour without making any progress. Seriously. It's not healthy.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n",

He's always happy to explain the finer points of Computer Science to us.  His office hours, immediately after class, are held at an unusually convenient time for most students and even if it takes him more time than he thought it would, we rarely go away with our questions unanswered.  In addition to holding his posted office hours, he vigilantly monitors the course discussion board.  His board posts are essential (and appreciated) given the difficulty of his assignments.\r\n\r\nThe 6 assignments can be quite time-intensive for people who are less than overqualified, including top students from the recommended prerequisite course (COMS W1004).  A substantial number of students have a much stronger background than this, and some have practically taken COMS W1007 beforehand.  These may be the people who would call the workload \"not too bad.\"  The rest of us just get a lot of programming practice.  Fortunately, the grading and grading curve are generous.  The median grade is usually B+, and this semester it might be A-.  \r\n\r\nLectures are understandable and thorough.  Professor Blaer sometimes talks so quickly that note taking becomes a bit difficult, but most of the material is from the textbook anyway.  The textbook, _Object-Oriented Design and Patterns_ by Cay Horstmann, explains concepts reasonably clearly but provides inexcusably buggy solutions to exercises.  Exams are long and information-intensive, but manageable if you've studied.\r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer LOVES to make fun of students who procrastinate (he never singles out individual people but talks about Columbia students as a group).  He is also merciful toward those who do procrastinate, because of his liberal extension policy.  Sometimes he says things about the average student's level of organization (i.e. our lack thereof) that aren't true.  I hope his lectures get put on CVN because they are so good, but those parts are cut because they reflect badly on Columbia University and are a lie.  Most students are doing well this semester, and our organizational skills are one of the reasons. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this course, but only if a student has taken COMS W1004 or the equivalent beforehand.

Honestly, the material from just the first two months helped me answer so many interview questions. The parts on memory and out-of-order execution were awesome, but the material on locking, coherence, and consistency...next level. It also tied together a lot of concepts I\u2019d seen in OS and other courses, and cleared up so many misunderstandings I had on how stuff really works.\n\nThe quality of instruction is top-notch. Prof. Sethumadhavan is super organized and has this incredible way of breaking down complicated concepts so they\u2019re easy to understand. He mostly used the board in class, which made it easier to follow along in real-time. Even when I missed a couple of lectures, I was able to catch up by borrowing notes and going to his office hours, where he was super approachable and willing to explain anything I didn\u2019t get.\n\nWe also worked through some in-class problems, which I found super helpful. I wish we\u2019d had more of those, but I get that we had a lot of material to cover. The TAs were great too. One of them mentioned in class that the key to doing well is to take good notes, review them regularly, keep up with the readings, and ask questions during office hours if anything\u2019s unclear. Honestly, that advice was gold\u2014if you follow it, you\u2019ll be in a really good place.\n\nThis was honestly one of the best educational experiences I\u2019ve had at Columbia. The class is not only incredibly well-taught, but the material is directly applicable to both other courses and real world situations. I\u2019d recommend it 100%\u2014it\u2019s an absolute must for anyone interested in systems.\n",

A lot of memory systems can be boiled down to types of caches and their implementations within large pipelines. Out of Order processors are the next large topic that really allows you to understand the life cycle of a program. I found this part to be the most challenging with all of the micro-architecture details, but extremely cool to learn. Finally, you'll end the class talking about Network on chips, GPUs, and ML centric chips. Overall, a very interesting class. Simha makes this class manageable since it has the potential to be one of the hardest CS/EE classes. Simha is actually one of the greatest professors in the CS department, he actually spends a lot of class making sure that everybody understands what he talks about.

A majority of his lectures involved him dissecting topics by drawing diagrams on chalkboards which ultimately allow you to understand how a CPU works from hardware to memory access in the pipeline to how the architecture presents itself from a programmer's perspective. He breaks down the more complicated subjects in the course so that they seem almost trivial and entertains all questions presented during lectures somehow answering them both thoroughly and concisely enough that the flow of the lecture is uninterrupted. He's also incredibly approachable and will gladly answer your most basic questions without making you feel judged for your lack of understanding.\n\nI highly recommend this class if you're a computer engineer or else if you have any mild interest in understanding how a computer actually works.",

He was not a particularly good teacher, and I was lucky that I\u2019d seen much of the first half of the course in Intro to EE; many of my CS friends were totally lost from the get go. We were all pretty confused during the second half as well, which covered computer architecture and assembly language. To his credit, Simha sent out regular surveys for feedback, and did seem to care. However, this does not excuse the fact that the problem sets were totally unlike what we had learned in class (as in going to class wouldn\u2019t even prepare you to answer them, you\u2019d need to read the textbook). Luckily, they were ungraded, and most people I know wouldn\u2019t do them.\r\n\r\nThe logistics of this class were the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and worse than anything I could possibly conceive of myself. Attendance factored into your grade, but since it was a 300 person class, Simha made us hold up signs with our name and UNI on them and then photographed the entire room (309), having the TAs search through the photo to mark us present. There were weekly \u201cstudy groups\u201d (recitations) that were longer than class itself and factored into your attendance grade. These were really awkward, since everyone would sit there and not pay any attention to the poor TA. For the midterm, which was after the semester had been moved to remote instruction, Simha had us film ourselves, record our screen, and submit both for full credit. Yikes! I know he\u2019s a security expert, but that is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, plus students were allowed to use the bathroom.\r\n\r\nSimha is a smart dude. He clearly knows the material well... he must have had a good professor when he took the class as an undergrad.",

For example, pipelining was discussed in class but there were no real, hands-on, \"get your hands dirty\" coding, simulation or hardware exercises to implement the idea. This can lead to confusion because as the semester goes by, the student sees more and more jargon/words without having had properly assimilated the information. But perhaps this is just representative of many classes at Columbia due to the lack of time and weariness students feel as the semester goes by.\r\n\r\nSome of the homework questions were based on optimizing code or running simulations of hardware, which is alright. But no circuit simulations. So more of a CS class than an EE class. \r\n\r\nMidterm was take-home and you had to skype the professor to discuss ideas. \r\n\r\nNo practice final. So only lecture notes to go back on. Pretty difficult final because a lot of the material wasn't properly integrated into the homeworks/paper reading and the huge breath of the lectures did not properly prepare for the depth of the final.

He waits for students to think through the examples he gives, entertains follow up questions and does not rush through the material. The midterm was challenging and a good opportunity to apply cache optimization techniques to a benchmark of scientific software. \r\n\r\nSethumadhavan verbally delivered the majority of the content for the course. During this time he drew hundreds of rectangles on the blackboard to illustrate the interaction of different computer hardware components. This often seemed frivolous and distracting. Lectures were sometimes obfuscated by sloppy or incomplete handwriting. Slides might help to organize and deliver important concepts clearly and concisely. \r\n\r\nGrading seemed arbitrary and feedback was delivered late, if at all. No comments were provided on the implementation section of the midterm and the grade was returned the day before the final. After the course finished in May, the homework was decreased by 10% of the total grade and the midterm was increased by 10% of the total grade contradicting what was stated on the syllabus and on Canvas throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nCS is a broad field. Some courses may be challenging due to inherently abstract or mathematical content. This is not the case with computer architecture.

It's essential for anyone who wants to write fast code -- for example, if you plan to work on operating systems, libraries, or high-frequency trading. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot from the lectures, despite being scheduled Thursday 7 - 9:30 PM when everyone is exhausted. Prof. Sethumadhavan was a great lecturer for the first half of the semester, but then he stopped making jokes (probably because he was tired like the rest of us - but jokes help us stay awake). There are definitely some lectures that were extremely dry even though they could've been interesting. Also, his explanations are unclear (self-contradictory) sometimes on complex things, like how to access a DIMM.\r\n\r\nThe most helpful part of the course was taking with Prof. Sethumadhavan during halftime and at the end of class. He is really great at explaining stuff in small groups and genuinely takes pleasure in hearing interesting questions from students. Wish I had attended office hours more.\r\n\r\nThe problems from the book truly horrifying - they are filled with ambiguities and errors - but my understanding is that there are not that many textbooks about computer architecture. Maybe there are some non-textbooks that we could integrate into the course. \r\n\r\nHowever, I really enjoyed the group homeworks where we had to argue about how to interpret computer architecture papers and write programs to demonstrate concepts from class. The midterm was in the same vein - come up with some optimizations and then implement them - so I also enjoyed it a lot.\r\n\r\nSometimes the assignments were poorly worded or had bugs. For example, the hw3 skeleton code did not properly check whether the optimization changed the program's output, despite several corrections by the TAs over two weeks. This did not affect our group because we figured it out, but had we not been so careful, we could've wasted a lot of time and had nothing to show for it.

The content overlapped with other classes too much. I have learned more from single assignments in other classes than I did from this entire class. \r\n\r\nDebbie seems to mean well but is unfortunately a terrible teacher. Her lectures are boring and honestly I could barely even hear her. She stares at her own slides and doesn't see you when you raise your hand to ask a question. Her notes are poorly organized and written in sentence fragments that leave out crucial context. She has basically no office hours. In the first lecture, I thought it was weird how she placed such strong emphasis on how important it was to come to class on certain days; it quickly became clear that this was because everyone was about to realize how useless it was to go to her class. I skipped about half of them and did better than almost anyone on the midterm. \r\n\r\nThe written homeworks were boring and felt like busywork. I answered them 100% correctly, and the TA even admitted as much, but regretted that he had to take off points by following the specific wording of Debbie's answers.\r\n\r\nThe programming was better but was rare. In 4119 we implemented a toy cut-down version of TCP; how about implementing a toy cut-down version of a TLS handshake? That's what I thought this class was about, not reading news articles about Android malware.\r\n\r\nThe group project was a huge waste of time. I could have done the entire thing myself in two days but wasted a huge amount of time trying to coordinate with my randomly selected group. The program itself was pretty lame, too, and had all kinds of arbitrary/ambiguous requirements that were more annoying than useful. ",

The rubric is harsh, so precision matters.\n- As always, start the labs EARLY. Not because they take forever, but reinforcing concepts early pays off in this fast-paced class.\n\n----------\nExams:\nJae is an awesome exam writer, testing your understanding to the finest detail.\n- The problems aren't impossible\u2013everything comes directly from the lectures and labs. The real challenge lies in managing stress and focusing on meticulous details.\n- Some problems offer generous partial credit. Others? Miss one part and the others crash down like an avalanche ...\n- Practice helps, but luck plays a role too. At the end of the day, we are human, not computers, not gcc -g -Wall. We make mistakes, and that\u2019s part of what makes us human.\n\n----------\nGrading\n\nHis grading system is statistically fair for a class with 400 students: on AVERAGE, good students do well, and bad students struggle. However, each of us only takes 3 exams, not 400, so this \"fairness\" may break down entirely on an individual scale.\n\nThe takeaway is: Always try your best, but never over-stress about your AP grade. It's your learning and improvement that matter. Your grade is just a number; it correlates with, but doesn\u2019t always define, your abilities.\n\nAlso don\u2019t lose sleep over an A+.

So the max you can get is 387.5/400, and the grade cutoffs are posted at the end. You won\u2019t get an A+, you probably won\u2019t get an A. After that, the curve gets very generous.

Borowski does baby you a bit and Jae does his best to make an upperclassman out of you.

The fearmongering about this course is INSANE and if you tell yourself the course is hard, it's only gonna make it harder for you. Yes, AP is a tough class, but if you put in genuine effort, you will be just fine! As with any course that is curved, you just have to do around average, so just make it your goal to score approx average on the HWs and exams. If you lower the bar, you'll be less stressed and score better.\n\nA lot of people say this course is useless. If you are a diehard SWE person, then you will also probably think it's useless. But, what many may not know is that a lot of roles want you to have a good understanding of basic networking, and that is exactly what AP teaches. \n\nHow to do well:\n-Show up to lectures. IN PERSON. Pay attention. So many people make the mistake of \"I'll just watch it later\".\n-If you don't understand something, ask for clarification IMMEDIATELY, either with classmates, TAs, or even Jae himself!\n-My most important tip: diagram/draft out the HWs ON PAPER before coding. HW6 (the second-hardest HW) took me only 2 hours to do because I wrote it all down on paper beforehand. If the paper version makes no sense, or if you don't even know how to start, go to the TAs and they will walk you through what to do.\n-To study for the exams, just do the practice exams over and over until you get nearly 100% on all of them. That's literally all I did to prepare. And yes, the exams don't always look like the practice, but if you do the practice exams, the actual exam will go way better for you.\n-Find a TA you like, and go to their OH every week. Make it a habit to go over content with them and ask them even the \"stupidest\" of questions.\n-DO NOT DROP LAB7. It will bomb your grade.\n\nI swear if you follow my advice above YOU WILL DO WELL. AP rewards attention to detail, hard work, and most importantly honesty. Like do not cheat. They will find you.\n\nMy grade breakdown:\nMidterm 1: slightly below average\nMidterm 2: exactly average\nFinal: 20% above average\nHW (with lowest dropped): considerably above average\n\nTL;DR: Just put in your best effort and ask questions.

That being said, while AP is definitely not an easy class, I would not really rate it as impossible, considering a lot of people do fairly well. \n\nI agree with most reviews here that Jae is a great lecturer and he can explain concepts very easily in his lectures. As for the content of the class, on the surface level, while the majority of the ideas taught in class are straightforward, they are prone to becoming really tricky really fast. In other words, you are expected to 100% understand a concept in order to do well in the exams. \n\nThis is a really demanding class, and people do well only if they put in the effort. ",

I strongly advise against this combo!\n\nJae is a funny, knowledgeable professor with a vivid passion for what he teaches. I would also argue that he is a very effective lecturer. \n\nThat being said, he seems disconnected from what students actually experience and learn in his class. Yes, this is a competitive school, and we expect top-notch education, but the brutal exams and harsh grading rubrics will almost certainly demotivate even the most determined student who truly wants to succeed in this class and stay passionate throughout the semester. Many students believe his exams simply require attention, but beyond that, you need to masterfully apply every tool you\u2019ve been exposed to, deeply analyze complex code under pressure, code on paper with precision, and navigate the provided materials for useful information.\n\nThe grading system adds to the challenge by offering little to no partial credit. Although the labs demand an extensive amount of time, they are entertaining and helpful for grasping the concepts on a surface level. However, they don\u2019t prepare you for the depth and rigor of the exams. While some lab content does appear in the exams, the labs are far less useful for exam preparation than Jae suggests. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m left unsatisfied with the course and feel I\u2019ve learned nothing particularly useful. It\u2019s disappointing, especially considering this is a 4-unit mandatory course requiring significantly above-average effort. I\u2019m expecting it to destroy my GPA.\n\nFriendly advice for those still determined to get an A: train yourself daily by following tutorials on YouTube or rewatching sections of his lectures. If you have the luxury of time, use it consistently and deliberately without overworking yourself\u2014 exams will appear significantly easier. But is it really worth it?",

C is a tough language, it's brutal and unforgiving, the exact opposite of python.  For me, the labs were not so bad because I had a good familiarity with C , git and Linux/UNIX fundamentals, but to those poor souls who had never seen C before, I can understand why this course is so challenging for them. Honestly, the first 2 or maaaaybe 3 labs were not so bad, but judging the difficultly from the perspective of someone who went in into the material \"cold\" with no C experience, I can understand why so many students leave negative reviews of this course. \n\nMy only major complaint about this course were the exams. They are deliberately made to be so incredibly challenging that you have to ask yourself why they are made to be so difficult. My educated, (conspiracy theory?), guess is that the exams are there simply to bring down the class average. That's literally it. That's all the exams exist for! Seriously, I'd roll my eyes as I read through the exam questions, almost laughing to myself at how ridiculous and \"try hard\" some of the questions were. Not all the questions were that bad, but some of them, c'mon, seriously?!\n\nIf you plan on working as a software engineer in the future and don't do well in this course, don't let your performance in this course make you feel bad. School is nothing like the industry, especially AP. This course does teach you a LOT of valuable things, but it's not at all representative of the industry. Learning C will make you a better programming, no doubt, and I can see why the professor designed the course as he did but if you didn't do well, don't let that get you down.

                "content": "TLDR: I hated pretty much everything about this class, it dried up any passion I had for learning CS, made me lose hope as a student at Columbia, and pushed me to seek therapy. I wish I could say that sentence was a joke or an exaggeration, but it was the literal truth. I switched to a different major after this course. This is not because this class is a weed-out (every one passes if you don\u2019t cheat). Rather, it\u2019s the soul-sucking, inhumane, pedagogical vileness and borderline insanity that occupies the mind of one Jae Woo Lee that pushed me away from this course and major, and he\u2019s a nice guy too so imagine that. \n\nMore comprehensive review: \n\nJae's philosophy is essentially: if you try, you'll learn a lot. \n\nWhat this does not mean: 1) you will do well on exams 2) you will do well on labs 3) content will click immediately. \n\nIn fact, it's quite the opposite. It is through the grueling intensity of this course's homework and the monumental challenges that are the exams that the fundamental material of this course will be cemented into your brain by the end of it (provided you don't cheat and pay attention). You will understand how a computer works (at the surface level at least); you will be able to work with a large pre-written codebase; you will be prepared for higher level systems and database courses. These are the central assertions that Jae makes in the first lecture and then rigorously proves over the course.  \n\nHowever, will you end up liking CS after this course? For many, I don't think so. Understanding and learning a lot does not equate to enjoyment. The massive influx of knowledge you get from this course comes at the cost of your passion for CS drying up. Jae will contest this. In fact, the paper he published (and continues to promote) about this course has (carefully selected) reviews of students who took his course and developed a newfound passion for CS that they did not get from data structures and 1004/1006/1002. One example includes a physics student who switched to CS after taking AP and then ended up getting a PhD in the subject from a top university. This entire paper is predicated on flawed reasoning (pretty typical for STEM professors attempting sociological research): that people study computer science because they like computer science. Most don't. Most saw TikToks about the 150k+ salary that software engineers make and decided to enroll in Intro-to-Java. Most see the degree as a means to an end (a job). A minority probably like systems as a subject (they'll end up taking OS or becoming TAs), but do not *DELUDE* yourself that this course is going to make you like CS if you view this degree as a path to an engineering job at some tech company. When this course is over, you will be relieved, so relieved as to the point that you might elicit a tear or two that it\u2019s finally over. You survived the war. The finish-line. You made it. Then, whether or not you have a brain, you\u2019ll either take more courses with Jae or move onto better professors. \n\nIs C + UNIX programming useful? No! Jae admits this in lecture 1. What you actually learn from this course is less about C and more about a) how a computer works and the internal memory processes behind it, b) the basics of OS, and c) how to practice iterative development. Teaching C and UNIX is simply a vessel to that end. \n\nSome niche advice: \n\nDon't fall into the cult of personality surrounding Jae. He's a nice guy, but he isn't divine when it comes to CS education. He will try to justify AP\u2019s structure and workload off of a paper he wrote in 2011; he will cite articles on his webpage about how Bwog considers AP one of the best classes at Columbia; he will crack a joke or two about his past life as a developer. \n\nDo not fall into this trap that you must take more courses with him. LEAVE. As that guy in Get Out said, GET OUT!\n\nHere are some immediate red flags that should tell you to leave: \n\n- In the first lecture, he led with \u201cyou\u2019ve probably read some bad reviews about me.\u201d \n- \u201cYou might not do well even if you try hard\u201d - a quote from his syllabus powerpoint. \n- He beefed with Hillary Clinton over some blackboards. Remember the last guy who publicly beefed with Hillary Clinton? Look what happened to him. \n- He continuously has to justify the difficulty of his course (mostly after every exam or an exceptionally hard homework) by citing papers he wrote, carefully selected student \n  reviews. \n- About 15 minutes before the second midterm, he emailed the entire class listserv a screenshot of text messages with his OWN SON who was taking AP as well. In these \n  messages, his son was lamenting about how hard one of the practice exams were. After this screenshot, Jae wrote a \u201cgood luck\u201d message and signed off on the email. Diving \n  into the thought process by this psychotic action, he probably wanted to convey \u201chey even my own son thinks my course is hard. Don\u2019t worry about that much.\u201d What it ended \n  up coming off as was \u201chah lol my son is struggling with exams I WROTE lemme expose him to a group of 650 classmates.\u201d\n\nThis course is a hurdle that every CS major has to get through. Climb, fumble, collapse, or jump effortlessly over this hurdle and do not look back! On the bright side, I know entire friend groups that formed during AP over the sheer collective trauma. You will leave this course with some new comrades to swap war stories with over a couple of cigars. You\u2019ll never see CS majors be more social than when the AP Lab is due. \n\nTo finish off this review, I'll leave a quote from his first lecture powerpoint: \"Please don\u2019t get stressed out about AP.\" \n\nI did.

If you fall behind by more than 2 weeks, consider P/Fing the course or dropping it entirely. It is extremely difficult to catch up. \n\nDon't take this course with other hard courses.

Lecture notes are uploaded to the webpage, so don\u2019t feel compelled to take copious notes. Focus on understanding. This starts at lecture 1 and does not end until the lecture before the final. \n\nI barely went to OH though. The TAs in this course definitely know what they're talking about content-wise but they're actual advice for doing well in this course is subpar at best. For example, a TA emailed us a practice exam problem, citing that we should be able to complete it in under 50 minutes. During the practice problem review session, it took the TA 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete the problem. Moreover, there was repetitive emphasis on \"drawing it out\" which I found to be garbage advice. For one, you only get 75 minutes for two-three fairly difficult questions. Spending time to draw everything out is wasting precious time to actually get to the right answer. "

You are not expected to know C or UNIX prior to the course, but if you want to do well, I'd highly recommend reviewing the aforementioned books, although Jae's lectures generally do a good job of explaining the material.\n\nThe programming labs in this class are excellent, they follow a steady progression, as each lab builds off the last. If you pay attention in class, read the book, meet with the TAs to clarify concepts you're confused on, than generally, you'll be fine. Yes, the more you progress through the course, the harder and more time consuming the labs become. A few tips for doing well: always test your code before submitting it, and START EARLY! The TA office hours are packed to the brim a few days before the lab submission is due.\n\nThe problem with this course are the exams. They are far, far too difficult and challenging, even by Columbia standards.

But this course is notoriously brutal. \nThis class is designed as a conjunction from the C programming language to advanced things such as operating systems and computer networks. So if you ask what I learned from this class, I'd probably say, nothing? Mmmmm, not really, a little bit of everything: OS, TCP/IP, database, etc. \nJae did really good in lecturing, and it's quite amazing how he just linked all this \"everything\" together. I don't need to explain this point since this is basically a consensus from everyone. You will like his lecture and learn a lot here! \nBut, the bad thing about this course is grading. Nobody wants to spend more than 25 hours a week on this class and only got a B, right? What you learned matters, for sure, but how much your input and what the GPA is also matters. I just can't understand why Jae does not really see this point. I almost spent half of my study time studying this course, but what I am expecting is a B/B-. I just keep on saying that it doesn't matter, at least I did learn something. But the reality is that the grade was, is, and will be harsh. \nJae said, yes, somebody learned this in advance, and they will surely do better and get better grades, though he doesn't encourage people to do so. So the unfair part of this course is, it doesn't award hard work, it awards knowledge. If you learned this, never go to the lecture, did everything perfectly, and you will get good grades. If you learn this the first time, you are not likely to end in A range anyway. \nI am just a normal guy, who never learned CS in high school and expected to study hard and do well in college. I just don't understand where all those crazy guys come from! They seem to know everything already! I want to get good grades as much as those guys! If every class in Columbia is designed like this, I guess I will never find a job with my GPA. Grade fxxking matters! Why can't he just curve the grade slightly better! \nI literally feel sick about how harsh the grade curve is, and it DOES NOT FAIRLY represent my efforts in this class! But lucky as I am, Covid 19 allows me to PDF it. \nWith regard to whether or not you should take this class, I mean, CS guys don't really have a choice? Right? So good luck with it!",

Despite its difficulty, I\u2019m pleased to say that AP with Jae has only reaffirmed my passion for CS.\nJae is fantastic. He cut out the C++ content and labs 8-10, which made the course far more manageable. His lectures were clear and I never felt lost. And even though he puts on a serious face in class, he\u2019s actually really cool and hilarious if you get to know him at the Hackathon. All the TAs in Spring 2021 were extremely patient and helpful, which was assuring given that the TAs in earlier CS classes were often hit or miss.\nThe course is still a rigorous step up from the toy programming in Data Structures. After all, pointers, memory allocation, and network programming are naturally tougher topics. However, AP isn\u2019t the weeder that it was (and probably still is) known for. It\u2019s true that the labs are longer, but Jae also gives plenty of hints during class, so you should always have some kind of entry point for each project. In addition, the specs are so detailed that you can guarantee yourself a perfect score every time.\nI took the class when the exams were still online. They\u2019re still the hardest part of the class, but I noticed that they were more similar to the labs than a lot of the sample paper exams were. This is probably why Jae always said you\u2019d get the most out of the labs if you did them all by yourself, and I would agree with his assessment. Yes, it sucks to stay up until 3am figuring out where your program is going wrong. But once you debug the error, your brain will be tuned to avoid repeating the same mistake in the future. You just can\u2019t achieve the same effect if you rely on the TAs to fix everything for you. If you don\u2019t go through that process yourself, you\u2019re going to struggle on the exams.\nAs for grading, I thought Jae had one of the most forgiving curves ever. For a \"weeder\" course, it\u2019s difficult to fail; the C- cutoff this semester was 12.456. It seems that the only way you\u2019ll fail is if you cheat or barely put in any effort.\nTL;DR: It\u2019s a great class and there\u2019s nothing to be scared of. Don\u2019t cheat, start the labs early, and you\u2019ll likely be fine.",

That being said, I managed to get an A- in this course and my goal is to hopefully not come across like I'm bragging but just to make everyone who's currently doubting their abilities heading into this course feel a little more confident in their potential to succeed.\r\n\r\nObviously all the reviews agree that it's hard, but it's up to you whether you want to treat it as a 'lifestyle' or not. I usually started the homework a couple of days before the due date (except for HW7) and got around the median each time. I think the two things that really helped me were the videos they uploaded on YouTube and rewatching the lectures but at twice the speed. Counterintuitively, as someone who really has trouble focusing in class, this forced me to pay attention since it gets rid of the little pauses where I would accidentally zone out. \r\n\r\nMaybe you'll like the listserv format or maybe you won't but either way, you're probably going to be stuck with it so use it to your advantage. It makes me nervous to ask questions anonymously, let alone in an email to everyone in the class, but it was helpful to go through each of them prior to the midterms and final and seeing whether I could answer in my head similar to how the TAs would answer each question.\r\n\r\nI would say you don't have to start reviewing super early for the exams (although like in all classes, the more time you leave to review the better your chances), you're the person who knows you the best so just leave yourself enough time to be able to go through the sample exams and ask questions to the TAs in person if you have any.\r\n\r\nI hated hearing the TAs say this, but the exams really are just basically like puzzles and it's a combination of luck over whether it covers your strengths and how much time you dedicated studying and absorbing the homework in general. Regardless of the amount of importance it might promote on itself, AP is still just a class in the end. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a couple of super freshmen in the course, but most of us have been here for at least a year now when taking it so just try your best to learn from your mistakes or successes in your previous courses and you should be ok.\r\n\r\nAnother very important thing to note, Jae won't fail anyone unless you cheat so if you start thinking about cheating because you're afraid of failing the course then know you would be so much better off just taking the L instead of receiving the cheating email at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

Since you have to do essentially every part of every lab by myself (besides TA help) my confidence in myself as a programmer grew a ton with every lab.\r\n\r\nThe exams are ~very~ hard, yet doable. If you stay on top of the material, start reviewing early, and understand what you are programming you can do well. The questions require clear knowledge of C fundamentals, and exams often include at least one question that is incredibly complicated. Exam questions are pretty similar to the types of questions on the sample midterms/finals.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of hype about how horrible and difficult AP was before I took the class. Don't let that scare you, it is totally possible to do well and have fun in this class!\r\n",

You will honestly learn the material better by going through the TA's recitation notes and going to the TA hours. \r\n\r\nLearning C and C++ is beneficial to anyone wanting to work in a CS-related field, but Jae insists on forcing students to memorize very specific syntax of functions, and \"punishes\" (his words) those who can't regurgitate the exact code on paper. Frankly, most of us found it ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe midterm exams are insane. The median is usually around the 40's-50's.  This should tell Jae (and Columbia) that his course is awful and is failing the students, but we all realized Jae takes some kind of sick satisfaction in teaching \"the hard course.\"\r\n\r\nJae also has this weirdly extreme obsession with cheating. This isn't exaggeration; he is constantly on a delusional witch-hunt for anything remotely close to what he considers cheating. Supposedly, he runs all written code through a program that compares your code to EVERY SINGLE SUBMISSION FROM THE PAST 5 YEARS. There are 3-400 people in the class per semester. Meaning that many people's code will match someone else's somehow, and if you deny it, he starts a full investigation. \r\n\r\nHow this sadist is still allowed to teach a required course for a major, I will never understand.

The short answer/long answer midterm exams were (I assume) intentionally impossible with class medians hovering around 45. The final was fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, true/false so was much much easier. Jae will send you practice exams. Do all of them. One of the hardest things about his exams is the way he words his questions and attempts to trick you, so practice exams help. \r\n\r\nAs an instructor...I found Jae to be too disorganized to learn from and preferred to study with my own materials. Pedagogically he was, honestly, a nightmare, a nightmare barely concealed sadist. and sometimes would send emails that told students they must \"suffer\". He also uses language like \"punish\" when speaking of how he likes to \"punish students who don't do ____\". Before he announces his miserably low medians, sometimes he will laugh for an extended period. etc. I found his teaching style completely creepy. And encourage Jae to get out his sadistic impulses in a more consensual environment. My friend told me some students thrive under these types of psychological tactics and are pushed harder. not me. and not many, many students I know. He is the only professor who teaches this course.

Kernel hacking and OS theory are by nature tougher beasts. There is no easy way to approach the material without severely watering it down. I found AP to be more enjoyable but only because I never felt lost. Yes there were some frustrating debugging moments but I always knew the path the success. OS was different. I felt completely and utterly lost multiple times while doing the hws. I questioned my love of coding, my humanity and my sanity, all while cussing out this class and the kernel documentation. Jae thrusts you into the wild with just the basic necessities (the roadmap for HW7 was generous and appreciated) and we were forced to find our way home. Some can consider this bad teaching. I think of it as tough love. It was necessary to push you to the next level. AP was for teenagers, OS is for adults. Once I became more comfortable with the kernel and its ways (around HW7), I found the class just as enjoyable as AP. Overall, great experience. I only refrain from ranking OS among my favorite courses since I am pretty sure it gave me PTSD. Maybe in a few years I will look back at OS with endearment. \r\n\r\nThe tests....They are much worse than AP's... coming from a guy who got 100 on the AP final. The T/F and multiple questions are really impossible to prepare for. Although the curve evens it out, I think it doesnt give students who've mastered the material a good opportunity to shine. \r\n\r\nIf you loved AP, you'll love this class. You learn a ton. Some example HW's were building a scheduler and a filesystem for Linux. \r\n\r\nI maybe would've liked if Jae spent more time on OS theory and less on Linux specific stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I wouldn't even want him as a TA for this class. \r\n\r\nHis two main objectives are: Make blisteringly difficult homeworks and tests, and catch cheaters. \r\n\r\nYou will hear him talk about cheating in almost every lecture. It's his favorite subject. He sent out several unprofessional emails to the class ranting and raving about cheating, including one where he called cheaters \"douchebags\". At the end of the semester, maybe three weeks before the final, he sent out a threatening email to those he suspected of cheating saying they had until the next morning to reply as to whether or not they cheated and the first word of their email had to be yes or no. If they said no there would be a formal investigation and the consequences would be much worse than if they just admitted cheating. He sent this email on a Friday night, where no one would be at the school to advocate for, or give advice to the students who received the email. I had some friends get the email, who didn't think they had cheated, but because of the threatening nature of the email, they didn't know what to do. Some of the cheating accusations came from homework assigned toward the beginning of the semester. So he waited until just before the final, when stress was highest, and sent a threatening email forcing students to incriminate themselves, or else. \r\n\r\nOne student gave him a doctor's note because they were sick during a test. He didn't believe them, and passed their note around to the TAs. There is no reason for him to share someone's medical information with TAs. \r\n\r\nThe tests were ridiculous. He gives you tests from past semesters to study from, but all they will do is show you that your test will be just as impossible as those were. The averages were low, something under 50 for the midterms, I believe. This is the only class I've ever had where I felt like I wasted time by studying. I don't care if I get a B+, if you give me a test where I get 40/100, I'm going to feel stressed and deflated. \r\n\r\nThe homework was insanely difficult and time consuming. If you have a ton of experience programming, far beyond Intro to Java and Data Structures, it might not be so difficult, but it will be time consuming. Think 20-30 hours per assignment toward the end. \r\n\r\nThis listserv for this class is annoying. You get dozens and dozens of emails a day. It's not well organized. \r\n\r\nThis has the opportunity to be a great class. Knowing C and C++ is very valuable. This class should not be taught by Jae Lee. No class that is required for a major should be taught by this man. People should be able to choose whether or not they want to subject themselves to his teaching. It blows my mind that he has good reviews on here. I feel like I'm looking at a conservative's Facebook page filled with pro Trump propaganda. The only reason I can think for this is that you've never felt relief like being done with this class. If you struggled through like most of us, you'll probably never want to think about AP again, let alone write something about it. ",

Still, it shows that he put a lot of thought into the way the class and assignments are laid out. I found the order of the material to be pretty natural and easy to follow, but I'm sure the syllabus is still changing every semester as he figures out how to teach this class. \r\nAlthough I found the lectures and readings easy to follow, my team and I really struggled with the homeworks. However, I'll admit that part of the reason that we struggled so much was that we did the readings right before the tests rather than before attempting to do the assignments. So, if you want to make your life easier, do the readings before you get down to coding. There will still be some shooting in the dark involved, but not nearly as much as if you only rely on your knowledge from the lectures. \r\n\r\nThat being said, what made the class truly enjoyable was having an amazing team. None of us knew each other before OS, but we became close friends by the end of the semester because we were spending close to 40 hours/week with each other for this class. It seems like an exaggeration, but I promise its true. We got pretty decent grades on most assignments, but we made very little progress on other assignments (despite the crazy amount of hours we dedicated to working on them). \r\n\r\nThe tests are classic Jae-style trickiness.

                "content": "Jae is an excellent lecturer who is very clear about his explanations. Even though his lecture notes are already quite good, it's definitely worth it to come to lectures, since Jae provides useful supplementary information and also runs sample code so one can see how the code exactly works. \r\n\r\nThe TAs are also very willing to help you with the code (as long as you put in the effort, of course). The recitations are more or less just review of the lectures, but if you want more practice or sample code, it's good to check them out.\r\n\r\nThe exams are quite tricky. The best way to prepare is to definitely read all of the lecture notes very carefully (VERY CAREFULLY), understand exactly what each line of code does, understand how each lab works, and read K&R or the C++ book carefully. It might even be helpful to write and run your own code to ensure you know what is happening. Furthermore, Jae might reuse exam questions from the previous midterms, so definitely learn from your mistakes. \r\n\r\nThe labs vary in difficulty. As long as you have the proper prerequisites (Data Structures, some familiarity working with UNIX commands and hopefully Vim/Emacs, and good coding habits) and as long as you follow along in class, the labs will be straightforward. Pointers are actually not that difficult if you follow along and draw pictures. The hardest lab is lab 7 in which you have to write a web server. It's not difficult conceptually, but it's difficult because there are many parts you have to keep track of. Make sure you debug your code constantly (instead of writing the whole lab in one shot) and get started early! Be sure you do well on the labs, since the averages for labs, unlike those for exams, are usually very high. \r\n\r\nPersonally I thought the listserv was a giant clusterfuck. However, if you care enough to look through all of the emails (questions about the labs, questions that have already been asked, emails from TAs exasperated at people who repeat the same questions), you can gain some useful tips for finishing labs or figuring out exam questions. Just make sure you search for your question before you create a new email, and don't reply-all to announcement emails. It's essential that you set up an inbox filter to filter all of these emails.",

He's actually nice if you get his attention.  It seems like he prefers a student that doesn't need their hand held (which is the intimidating part) but pestering him is a good way to show him you care/will work hard.  I think that could be why some students don't like him as a person.  If it's really that bad, then hire a tutor (I did).  Your tutor is pretty much your employee at that point.  If you can't hire a tutor (a good CS tutor is $$$$$), then you need to make sure this is the only difficult class you are taking because you will live in the TA room.  If you can't either see Jae, hire a tutor, or be in the TA room for almost every OH, then you are probably cheating in order to do well.\r\n\r\nMy advice for the cheaters is that you will get caught so proceed with caution.  You could lie (most cheaters are also liars), but you'll get caught!  I can't stress this enough.  Jae says this in the beginning too and people still think they can do it. \r\n\r\nMy advice for if you don't cheat (i didn't but I almost regretted not doing it), just let it go.  I think Jae pretty much hit the nail on the head when he said those people who cheat like that won't make it very far in the world of CS.  Just worry about yourself and try your best to have fun.  There was an intrinsic reward in the end.  I did become a better programmer after this and real world programming made just a little more sense.  \r\n\r\nGo to every lecture and don't bother opening your laptop.  The notes are posted to the server so stop pretending you're taking notes and just watch what he does.  Read over the notes later.\r\n\r\nUse the drops and extensions strategically.  You will need them, but try not to drop any of the ones right around the midterm.  I think around lab5-8/9 (can't fully remember) is when you really should focus.\r\n\r\nThe exams are tricky.  If you don't like your grade just argue a lot.  I will say that if you KNOW how to do the homework, then you KNOW what he's asking in the exam.  You'll be able to argue for your points (all points matter) if you KNOW.  Also, his exams are pretty much from the lectures and old exams. ",

                "content": "Have mixed feelings about this class. Took AP with Jae many years ago and can say that it was significantly better run and more structured than OS. He seemed much less prepared to teach this class. The content wasn't terribly interesting. We spent a lot of time on UNIX APIs and not enough time kernel hacking. It was an 8:40 am class so no one really showed up. It didn't really matter since Jae would just talk about a couple of functions from a man page for an hour any way. Most of the learning is done on your own by reading many chapters from 3 textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe first midterm was poorly written and essentially required you to know random facts from the textbook and didn't really test conceptual thinking. The second was slightly better but still overall not a great test.\r\n\r\nThe HWs were hard. Required a lot of reading of man pages, kernel code and experimenting. Doing it on your own was a miserable experience that led to many sleepless nights. Always felt pressed for time on the group projects. I never felt intellectually challenged by any of it but did feel like it was a lot of worked. There was never an aha moment where I appreciated the beauty of an operating system. It's just a mangled mess that we deal with since that's how some bloke decided things should be done many decades ago.\r\n\r\nEnsure that you form a good team. They don't have to be incredibly smart, just very hardworking, sincere and accountable. Mine didn't do any work which led to a lot of incomplete homeworks since it's kind of impossible for one person to finish the HW on their own unless they're willing to devote well over 10 hrs/week to it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was slightly disappointed in this class given that I thought AP was fun and easy. Jae needs to step up his game here. You might want to take the class with Jason Nieh who is an OS researcher and will focus more on kernel programming, but be warned that his workload is even worse. I do think that every CS major should take OS. It's surprising that Columbia doesn't make it a requirement. That said, I begrudgingly took it.\r\n\r\nTAs for this class were great fwiw.

By the end of the class, you will have coded a linked list in C, written your own web server, and some minimal C++ experience, all of which isn't that impressive on paper. However, the skills you learn here will be applicable to nearly any job you hold as a computer programmer unless it's really implementation-heavy front end stuff. Even then, you will come away with experience of having to read lots of documentation with very little guidance on how to use it, which is expected of all programmers. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do programming as a career and are debating taking this class because of the grading, take it anyway. You'll learn a lot more than you think regardless of your grade. He grades to a A- and in my semester he curved everyone to at least a C-. I did terribly on my first exam and still eked out a B+.\r\n\r\nThis is sort of a requirement: get to know your TAs really well.

I'm not sure when he will teach the course again, but I wanted there to be a CULPA review so that people can go into this well-informed.\r\n\r\n--- The Course ---\r\nI learned a ton from this course, though I didn't necessarily realize it as I was slogging through. Jae reformatted the course and taught it with undergrads in mind, which was appropriate given that the class had many more undergrads than in past years (no doubt because of Jae's popularity). As such, much of the first half was actually an extension of AP (lab7/http-server) used to teach OS concepts such as concurrency, memory sharing, and inter-process communication (user space programs to teach kernel stuff). It again demonstrates Jae's theory of teaching, using previous knowledge in order to bridge the gap to new concepts. With regard to content, Jae put a great deal of time into UNIX programming compared with hardware knowledge / kernel hacking. Jae explains that the earlier stuff is more applicable and the latter stuff is changing (e.g. we didn't cover hard disks, probably because SSDs sort of shift that paradigm). I buy his explanation. The pacing of the course wasn't great, with probably too much time spent on UNIX programming on the front and too little systems/kernel work at the end. Of course, this is understandable given that this was Jae's first time teaching OS and that he completely restructured it.\r\n\r\n--- Homework ---\r\nA few individual assignments (that are pretty easy) with mostly group projects (up to groups of three). Having a good group is obviously helpful. All the projects run on Arch Linux, which you will set up on VirtualBox. The assignments usually didn't involve much coding, but rather a lot of understanding how the code runs and scouring the internet. In other words, frustrating yet also good practice for the real world. The assignments have good underlying structure, but still need refining (again, should get better over time). Sidenote: the listserv from AP carries over as well, and will save you hours of struggle if you follow closely.\r\n\r\n--- Exams ---\r\nI got destroyed on the midterm, but in hindsight it was one of the best crafted CS exams I have ever seen. It definitely tested your ability to read code and apply the concepts we learned. The final was very different and a bad evaluation of our mastery in my opinion: 25 multiple choice questions about very specific things we covered (i.e. very un-Jae-like). Both exams unfortunately do not provide room for partial credit.\r\n\r\n--- Lectures ---\r\nNot incredibly interesting, but still important to really ingrain the material in your head. Jae mostly worked off of powerpoints, which I found ineffective. The few times he used the board were better. For me, printing the notes/slides beforehand and taking notes directly on them worked best.\r\n\r\n--- Grading ---\r\nJae curved to a high B+, which I consider pretty generous. Just be very VERY careful to follow homework instructions exactly as stated. Lots of times grading occurs on scripts, so the slightest problem could send your grade down just for not properly following basic instructions.\r\n\r\n--- TAs --- \r\nJae carried over the best AP TAs and I assume he would do so in the future as well. There was also a contingent of Chinese grad student TAs who were friendly, but generally less helpful.\r\n\r\nI doubt I've covered everything, but hopefully someone after me can fill in any missing gaps. On the whole, I would say to take the class with Jae if you are an undergrad (and if he ever teaches it again).",

It's truly inspirational how Jae teaches (Sidenote:  Chris Mulligan and Jonathan Balsano, the head TA's are also a plus for this course; they know everything and they will go the extra mile to make sure you know the way Jae wants you to know the material). The labs get progressively harder (lab 2 is particularly challenging for those that only know Java and thinks they know everything).\r\n\r\nJae hands out a bunch of very clear yet brief set notes for every topics. The listserv is very useful and you won't have to wait more than a couple of hours before a TA responds to your questions.\r\n\r\nThe bad part are the exams. For all the thought Jae puts into the labs and lectures, I feel he hasn't figured out a way of writing exams that aren't so unforgiving yet as challenging as the ones he cooks up. No matter how many hours you spend studying for the exams, you will be challenged. There are no easy questions. You almost certainly will need to go through an overly-complicated program that makes you follow 10-15 logical statements that intersect and go through overly-complicated loops. Almost always the questions will be either right or wrong, and there aren't many questions (usually 10 in midterms, 20 in final). Normally this wouldn't be such a problem, but each question usually tests for 3, 4 or 5 things at the same time. So even if you knew everything there is to know about 4 concepts, if you missed the one, you won't get the answer right (guessing here is really, REALLY bad) and you will probably end up losing a bunch of points. His exams are all or nothing, meaning that you won't get partial credit over anything. You truly are as strong as your weakest topic.\r\n\r\nThen again, if you want to be a programmer or you want to do something related to programming later on, take this course. You will learn more in 3 months than you could expect in a year. If you are not a programmer, nevertheless take this course. Programming is all about getting rid of any assumptions you may have and think logically and methodically and CS3157 makes you develop those skills more than you ever thought possible.",

                "content": "I took this class 1.5 times. I started as a sophomore, shortly after 1004, with the mindset of \"let me just make this program work.\" That mindset led me to a 50% by the time the withdrawal date came around (which would've been a B-, but I thought I was failing) so I withdrew.\r\n\r\nI enrolled in the class again 2 years later, this time with the programmatic maturity to understand what the class was really about, and why that information mattered. Although the classwork takes the format of programming assignments, they are really about the underpinnings about C/languages (e.g. memory management, pointers, etc.). If you want to learn it well, you should break things! Rewrite your labs in different notations (e.g. array vs. pointer) to learn the differences. Become intimate with C. \r\n\r\nThe reason I mention my backstory is to help advise students who are on the fence about taking the class now or later. Some people can handle AP early on. But two years ago I honestly didn't care about freeing memory or understanding where my variables were stored. I gradually developed that interest after taking a few more CS courses/ being asked such things in interviews, and I am very happy I had the opportunity to take AP again. I got a lot more out of it, and the class was immensely more interesting.  \r\n\r\nThe class has 10 labs, of which 1 (lab 8) is optional. In the past, Jae had a policy of only granting class-wide extensions and every lab would be extended. He has changed his policy, for the better, to allot everyone 7 penalty-free late days each, to be used whenever (with a max of 2 late days for a given lab). This is a great policy, since it allows you to manage your time a lot better.\r\n\r\nThe class also has 2 midterms and a final. The all-or-nothing nature of many of the questions means the grades are relatively polarized--you could do extremely well or extremely poorly, for missing 1 simple thing. If you get above a 90, you really know what's up.\r\n\r\nSo I mostly wrote this review to call out the author of the last post (December 2013) regarding handling of the final. To give readers some context, several people in the class missed 5 points of a 20-point question for different reasons and proceeded to somewhat aggressively mail the list-serve arguing over which wrong answer was \"less wrong\" and deserved 2 extra points. Several TAs and Jae explained the reasoning to the rubric in response. \r\n\r\nTo insult Professor Lee's English, when he so eloquently and rationally addressed each concern from the email chain in a class announcement, is incredibly rude and borderline racist. Full disclosure: I missed 10 points of the same problem for a different reason, and though I disagreed with the severity, I had the decency to not make personal attacks.\r\n\r\nThough I found grading in the class sometimes tough, and I did not do as well I as would've liked, I learned *a lot* and became a much better programmer. Much of this is due to Jae. He is one of the few people in the department devoted exclusively to his students. I have personally experienced how he uses student feedback to iterate on his teaching from semester to semester, in order to better serve his students. He organized a class hackathon this semester, complete with pizza, Insomnia cookies, and t-shirts, to help students connect on an informal level. He stayed there the whole time, until 5:30 am, making sure he chatted with everyone at least once before he ran off to take his son to soccer. He learned my name despite the large class size (I never attended office hours or anything either).  He is one of the best professors I have had in the department, and I would recommend taking his class to anyone mature enough (as a programmer/student/person) to handle it.",

                "content": "I agree in general with the May 22 2013 reviewer on some of the basics (don't go anywhere near anything taught by Shlomo Hershkop, the exams are a bit of a crapshoot, details on labs can be a bit overwhelming but the detailed specs are ultimately a net positive) so go read that and then I'll focus on a few points where we differ to some degree/where things have changed:\r\n\r\n- This not \"just a programming class.\" Getting familiar with C means getting familiar with a lot of low-level system functionality. If you don't understand pointers and memory management completely intuitively, you'll never really understand what's going on in higher-level languages like Java. Jae Lee definitely gets you acquainted with pointers and memory management.\r\n\r\n- But you will learn a lot about real-world programming. For example: I hated the listserv early on and sent the professor a frustrated email about it, but I came around eventually. A lot of the big (and small) open source projects are built around listservs and all that comes with them. This class's listserv gets you used to the number and type of emails (including repetitiveness), the personalities that appear (the noob who asks a question he could've googled, the guy who replies to everything within 10 seconds but is kind of an asshole, the Benevolent Dictator For Life, i.e. Jae Lee, etc.), and so on.\r\n\r\n- YAXing (as many extensions as you want) is gone as of this semester. By all accounts, that's a big improvement. Also, we had two midterms this time around instead of just one.\r\n\r\n- I felt that the exams assessed the material quite fairly, although they generally played to my strengths and I did well on them without studying, so people who studied a lot and still did poorly likely feel otherwise with good reason.\r\n\r\n- Focus on the principles, not the details. C, C++, Unix and TCP/IP all have a really deep underlying logic and if you can wrap your head around it you're set. Everything is there for a reason. If you remember the reason you can derive the details on the exam. For example, in Unix and C \"everything is a file\" (external devices, actual files, other programs, etc.) so when you write to stdout you're writing \"to a file.\" When you read from stdin, you're reading \"from a file.\" Sockets can be treated exactly like a file. BUT because \"everything is a file,\" a \"pointer to a file\" (FILE *) can't possibly be an ordinary derefencable pointer -- dereferencing, after all, is the act of visiting a location in memory and reading some information out, which you can't conceivably do with a web socket -- so if you worked through that logic, you wouldn't make the mistake some people did of thinking that a file pointer can be dereferenced. So, principles, not details.\r\n\r\nIn general, I liked this class a lot, though a grading dispute on the final exam made me seriously question Professor Lee's judgment/command of the English language. However, given that I did not witness any other such problems, I'll be charitable and assume it was a truly isolated incident.",

                "content": "I definitely wasn't alone in that I had a lot of mixed feelings about this class.  I'll start by saying that is certainly the only viable option for taking Advanced Programming.  (Sidenote: If you're even thinking about taking Shlomo Hershkop's course, you're better off dropping out of school than wasting your tuition on an insulting elaborate practical joke).  However, I wouldn't call this class an amazing one that you absolutely have to take before you graduate, unless of course it's a requirement.  It really is just a programming class.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I have no plans to take OS and I'm not sure when I'm going to use C again.  The general theme of this course was \"trust me - this will all be useful later.\"  As a result, the subject was as uninspiring as it gets, unless you happen to love learning about large amounts of syntax and technicalities of programing languages.  \r\n\r\nThe best part of the course was the labs (programming assignments).  They were very well written were never had ambiguities.  These assignments are the same every semester, and solutions are provided immediately after the deadline.  Though this technically makes it very easy to cheat, keep in mind that the labs are the core of this class, and there's no point in taking it if you're not interested in working through each of them.  Because they were so detailed, they could be a bit overwhelming to read the first time through, and it is very important to follow the instructions to the letter.  Ultimately, they were very enjoyable to work through, and I can honestly say I learned almost everything that I learned in this class from working through the assignments.  Rubrics were provided for each lab that clearly stated how points were awarded.  \r\n\r\nI personally didn't find the lectures that I attended all that helpful.  The ones at the chalkboard gave good introductions to topics, and I profited the most from these.  He'd often go over something too quickly, and then be asked to repeat it three or four times more.  Occasionally, he'd repeat a large portion of the previous lecture, though it was impossible to tell when he would do that.  Ultimately, it was clear that he made the effort, but had trouble keeping everyone in the large classroom on the same page.  There were a lot of times when he'd explain something simple, or say \"you remember this from last time, right?\" and then five minutes later someone would raise their hand and ask about it.  When he did hour-long demos from the computer with the lights out, I found it very difficult to focus.  I'd always try to follow along with him, inevitably miss one step and therefore be lost for the rest of the demo.  \r\n\r\nThe pacing was also strange, as the last three weeks were the only time we spent programming in C++.  Almost the entire first half of the semester was dedicated to the C language, and the remaining time was spent on systems programming in C.  I understand that the training in C might be important for people who plan to take OS, but for everyone else it seemed like overkill.  \r\n\r\nI really never got the point of the whole YAXing policy.  Looking back, the deadline for every lab besides the first one was extended, and roughly half were extended twice.  Sometimes, the announcement of the extension was within 24 hours of the original deadline.  Talking to previous students and looking at CULPA reviews, I see that he's been doing this same practice since he started teaching.  I can't help but wonder why.  It would make a lot more sense for him to just tell us how long we truly had for the assignment so that we could plan ahead.  At this point in teaching the class, he probably knows how long he actually plans to give the class for assignments. \r\n\r\nThe mailing list was something about which I seemed to have the minority opinion.  I was really not a fan of it.  It might've worked better with a smaller class, but for a class of 140 students it bordered on absurd.  There was so much showing off and subtle attempts to suck up to Jae.  Some attempts were not subtle at all; for example, when the final exam solutions were mailed out, one student sent out an email saying that the exam was very well designed, and that this was the best course he had ever taken.  People would also use the mailing list to tell the class about how they went further and did additional work.  \r\n\r\nThe worst part of this class, and by far the most frustrating, was the evaluation process.  Jae said on the first day that it is very difficult to write an exam that assess what we truly know.  After seeing last semester's exams, it is clear that he is making the exams substantially more difficult by the semester.    He always said that working independently through the labs was the best way to prepare.  As someone who did just that, I can frankly say I've never felt so unprepared for exams as I was in this class.  The issue wasn't my approach to the labs, nor was it that I wasn't studying hard enough.  The midterm was about the same length as the final even though the final was given during final exam period.  There were a total of 17 questions on the final, and every single one of them was either a (very) short answer or multiple choice, with absolutely no partial credit under any circumstances (and trust me, there were plenty of places to mess up).  Questions would be asked on code fragments that were as long as 3 pages.  Single short problems would often test 5 ideas at once and carried a high all-or-nothing point value.  To add insult to injury, there would be multiple questions testing the same trick.  It seemed crazy to me that single trick multiple choice questions carried the same amount of weight as entire programming assignments.  The only reason I didn't feel worse when walking out of an exam where I had to make a semi-educated guess on most questions was because I knew that no amount of preparation would've been sufficient.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the final curve is very generous, with half of the class receiving at least an A-, and this will save you at the end of the semester if you work hard and have the right amount of luck.  The grades on both exams truly ranged from 0 (yes, zero) to 100, with the median on each around a 50.",

When I saw he was teaching again after he got his PhD, I was like YES, and now at the end, I'm just like meh. \r\n\r\nWell, the start was good. He set up a listserv to encourage class participation where students could ask questions and interact with TAs and other students. Everything was explained slowly for people who have never been exposed to C, but then he started to get behind on his lectures. That was sort of when things started going down hill. The labs were fun, but he would not have covered the material for them, and so he had to rush in class to cover what we needed to know on the labs, rather than take a good amount of time explaining things. Inevitably, he would have to YAX (yet another extension) them so he allowed people a reasonable amount of time to finish them. He also changed the labs from counting 40% of the course grade to 15%, which in my opinion has hurt a lot of people. We spend A LOT of time on doing the labs, which is why I think they should count more. That's where we do most of our learning, and where we can demonstrate we have an understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was really hard. After he gave us the midterm from fall 2011, which seemed very doable, the actual midterm was a disaster. The average was a 50 with a standard deviation of like 23. As someone who did well on the labs, I figured I was going to be fine on the midterm, but when I saw the midterm, I panicked because it seemed incomprehensible. I feel like I could have done a lot better. \r\n\r\nThe second half of the class felt rushed. The C++ things seemed VERY rushed. The last two labs are C++ oriented. Honestly, I'm on the verge of taking the final and still don't feel like I know that much about C++.\r\n\r\nI think Jae was very stressed this semester with a class of almost 200 people and that detrimentally affected his teaching ability. Overall, I wasn't blown away by this class. I feel like I didn't really profit from his lecturing style, but I have to agree that the labs are very well designed. ",

However, he spent almost half of the semester just teaching C language and as a result, the rest of lectures (netcat, building a web server, C++, etc) were very rushed. Many of my friends who had no knowledge of how web servers work struggled. Example codes and other references were provided but was hard to consume even after attending Jae's lectures.\r\n\r\nGrading was fair since there was no partial credit on midterm or final, but because of that, it did not truly reflect how much a student understood the material. Median grade for almost all labs were perfect grade--so labs did not affect your grade that much if you're in the top 50%, the average grade for midterm was very high while the avg for final was around 60, which made the final exam the only differentiating factor of the grade for most of the students. Also, even though the final covered materials from about 6~7 labs, the test only focused on 2~3 labs and *everything* was one word answer with no description allowed--no coding, no partial credit, etc, which penalized students who \"almost got it\" very heavily.\r\n\r\nOne thing that made Jae's class great was its clean organization. The organization of lectures (order, increasing level of difficulty, etc), mailing list, rubric for grading each labs, lecture notes and lab manuals were all very useful and carefully crafted.

He would also always extend the lab due dates to reasonable dates for everyone.\r\n\r\nTests were fair. He emphasizes that doing the labs on your own and understanding what's really going on will be the best preparation for the exams, and he means it. I didn't need to study much else beyond reviewing the lab solutions.\r\n\r\nJae also set up a course listserv in which he (Jae), the TAs, and the students could all participate.

Gil likes to bring his research of statistics into the classroom and sometimes supplements the book for his slides he created while at MIT. They are full of statistics and other advanced topics which are asked on most of the homeworks.\r\nThe statistics which are briefly discussed in class are a large portion of the homework and exams.\r\nThe programming assignments were time consuming, but pretty simple if you have used threads and sockets before.

Out of a class of 100+, only a handful of students even bothered showing up towards the end. \r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem if we had a remote idea of what material we were responsible for knowing. We were given literally zero resources to prepare for the exams - no sample exam, no list of topics review, not even chapters in the book that would be covered. Multiple questions posted on Piazza about the scope of the exam were left unanswered. This is after not having a single written assignment for the entire course. There was exactly one programming assignment covering material from the second half of class, but it was due the week following the final exam, which is just bizarre.\r\n\r\nThe exams themselves are a frustrating joke - 40% of the material on the midterm came from 4 one-word answers (two yes/no), with no partial credit. Stolfo said this was because it made grading easier.\r\n\r\nIf you do wind up suffering through this course, I really hope you don't give a shit about your grade. The AI tournament is worth as much as the final exam, and involves students programming a game-playing intelligence and playing against each other. While it's a cool idea, 20% of your grade comes form how well your program does in the tournament. It's a single-elimination tournament. Meaning that it's possible to have the second-best program in the entire course, but if you get paired with the first-best program in the first round, -15 points for you (there's a five-point \"losers bonus\").\r\n\r\nNot only that, but half the class is grad students, and there aren't separate tournaments for grad students and undergrads. Meaning you could get paired up with a Ph D student who's been working on their algorithm for a month because it's the only class they're in. I don't know a single undergraduate who made it past the first round.\r\n\r\nI think the most frustrating part of this course is that all of the above concerns were brought to Stolfo's attention multiple times by multiple students - he seems to either not care or not listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Stolfo managed to make interesting material difficult to learn through his insufferable lecture style and frustrating programming assignments.  He rants and pontificates, only occasionally delivering actual content.  He seems to teach this class to have a captive audience for his jokes, which alternate between offensive and inane.  Many are posted on his website, reflecting his general unprofessionalism.  I found Stolfo so loathsome that I couldn't bring myself to go to lecture for the last month.  When I tried to watch the lectures online (they were all posted because the class is offered to CVN students) I couldn't watch for more than 20 minutes.  He started one class sulking because the 15 people who still attended class were not being responsive enough to a series of vague/inane questions.  He tries to put on a dramatic and inspiring performance (like Gulati perhaps) but since he utterly lacks charisma the result is grating.  For example, he asked the class on numerous occasions, \"do you remember when you first touched a stove and learned what hot means?  do you remember? do you?\"  He would keep this up until someone pretended like he or she had a memory of this exact experience.  To most, this would seem like a rhetorical question but he wouldn't stop until he received confirmation that this very same scenario had happened to each of us.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were almost entirely composed of trick questions rather than straightforward questions about material that we had actually learned.  I think they were supposed to be easy but I didn't understand what they were asking.  Since I got around the mean grade on each, it seems like most of the class was similarly bewildered.\r\n\r\nStolfo's approach to teaching Lisp was to reminisce about the early days of computer science when it was just an elite group and make us fix buggy code.  While the programming assignments were ultimately the only worthwhile part of the class, I think they could have been less frustrating while still teaching the same important lessons.  After being exposed to Lisp for 50+ hours, I felt like I had learned how to conquer it and work around its structure rather than actually feeling comfortable.  While Stolfo's introduction to the language was certainly inadequate, Lisp is basically just a frustrating language.\r\n\r\nIf you can tolerate these jokes (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sal/notes/y13.html) or find them amusing then take the class with Stolfo.

He's an engaging, funny lecturer, the material is interesting, and the homework is a genuine pleasure to code. \r\n\r\nMost of the time, though, he doesn't teach it properly. Stolfo seems to have gotten it into his head that AI ought to be conducted like a Socratic seminar; as a consequence, you will spend most of your time in this class in awkward silence people do their best to avoid making eye contact. To make matters worse, he has a particularly nasty tendency towards extreme vagueness, so his questions tend to be things like \"so what is it about this problem?\" or even \"what was the thing that you learned during the first half of the course?\". That may fly CC, but in a computer science class (and particularly one requiring an above-average level of formal rigor) it's hard to imagine a less effective teaching style.\r\n\r\nThe real problem here is that because nobody answers his questions, the lectures creep ahead very slowly, and class falls further and further behind schedule while trying to get through basic material. Then, he realizes how far behind we've fallen and skips ahead over all the tricky stuff. As a result, we ended up spending a week and a half on BFS and a day on alpha-beta pruning, and two weeks on symbolic logic followed by fifteen minutes about Bayesian inference.\r\n\r\nThat same vagueness also seems to manifest itself on just about every exam question, which might explain why the average on both midterm and final was below a 60% (and mind you, this is a class made up of half MS and PhD students).\r\n\r\nWhat's really maddening is that on the handful of days he says \"Fuck it, I'm just going to lecture today\" the class is great. If he could be somehow persuaded to do this all the time I would have no hesitation at all in recommending this class; as things are right now, my feelings are mixed.\r\n\r\nOther random thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe TAs were some of the best I've ever had -- friendly, approachable, and (with the exception of one disastrous mistake that made the midterm quite literally 25 times harder) very knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nI came into this class with the rather unique advantage of already knowing Lisp. Regardless of what the syllabus may say, they will teach you no Lisp at all, but you will be expected to know it. If you, like 90% of the class, have never seen it before, you might be well-served by picking up a copy of SICP to read over winter break.\r\n\r\nMake a real effort for the gameplay tournament. Five or ten points is nothing to scoff at when everybody fails the midterm (and it's fun).\r\n\r\ntl;dr. The short answer is that I don't see any good reason not to take this class over Pasik's, and if Stolfo cleans up his act for next year it may even wind up being your favorite.",

Junfeng says you can qualify for extra credit that can bump you to an A+ if you attend class, but this wasn't worth it for most people. Since the class was at 8:40, the classroom was usually a ghost town after the first month. The lectures are recorded, but they're very loosely related to the assignments.\n\nThe only value comes from the semester long group project, where the class breaks off into teams of 4 to develop a SaaS solution using Ruby on Rails. It's imperative that you find competent teammates ASAP. Don't be afraid to sell yourself on the Ed discussion board\u2014if you have prior internship/work experience at FAANG/M7/HFT or any other prestigious firm, then leverage the hell out of it! Unless you already have friends in the class, this is the only way to ensure that you'll find likeminded teammates. The project is 50% of your grade and you'll be stuck with your team for the whole time, so choose wisely.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend if you need an easy class to fill a COMS 41xx requirement. If you just want to learn Ruby on Rails, you might as well go through the edX course on your own time.",

The good, mediocre and bad:\r\n\r\n---The good:\r\n- Professor Yang is well-intentioned and prepares for lecture\r\n\r\n- All class notes and materials are easily available on the website\r\n\r\n- Expectations are clear\r\n\r\n- Problem set portions of HW are pretty straightforward\r\n\r\n- Very fast Piazza response\r\n\r\n- Midterm and final are reasonable and open book\r\n\r\n- Exposes students to research (via required paper reading referenced in both lectures and tests, and via frequent observations by Prof Yang during lecture about what are current research topics and how previous topics were explored over time)\r\n\r\n-QEMU/vx6 combo is clear and good to learn from (unfortunately only used in 1 of 6 HWs)\r\n\r\n\r\n---The mediocre:\r\n- Modern Operating Systems textbook is a bit out of date and loaded with thinly veiled opinions, although it's not bad\r\n\r\n- Lectures try to pack way too much material in. Luckily they aren't very relevant, since you can pretty much learn from the slides (and watch portions on CVN if needed) so you don't need to actually go in order to get decent grades on midterm and final. Much of the lecture material is irrelevant to HW and tests \r\n\r\n- Some of the TAs' attitudes to students are borderline insulting (although others are good and very devoted on Piazza)\r\n\r\n- A lot of students seemed very upset about the grading/curving on Piazza at the end although personally I thought it was fine. Prof is reviewing results in response to the outcry (as I mentioned above, it seems he does actually care about the class, even if some aspects of the class are problematic)\r\n\r\n- Group projects. Ugh\r\n\r\n\r\n---The bad:\r\n- Largely useless programming assignments that generally amount to copy pasting and then hacking up existing kernel code. You spend much more time wrestling with various dev tools, resetting your tablet for one kernel crash after another, dealing with complete lack of kernel debugging tools, etc than actually learning OS concepts. The class should really be called \"android hacking\" instead of \"operating systems\"\r\n\r\n- Way too many technologies/tools involved. QEMU emulator, vx6 code, linux kernel code, adb, x86, ARM, complex macros, makefiles, gdb, git, android bootloaders and VMWare just off the top of my head. So again you wind up getting bogged down in tool specific details and spending way too much time on that rather than fundamental OS concepts\r\n\r\n- Extremely slow grading\r\n\r\n- Little relationship between HW (both code and prob sets) and tests\r\n\r\n- \"Interactive\" code grading sessions with TAs. They are intended to encourage fair work-sharing among group members but do nothing of the sort. TAs are not comfortable dealing with the students in person and in fact just skipped doing these for latter HWs\r\n\r\n- Kernel development textbook is bad. Hardly any actual code examples to show how one might add features to the kernel. Mostly high level overviews that are only partially accurate and copy-pastes of comments and headers from existing kernel code (which you can look at on your own without the book)\r\n\r\n- HW4 (scheduling) was painful. Much much harder than other HWs. They let students drop one but they should just get rid of this HW since almost everyone winds up dropping this one anyway and it is by far the worse offender in terms of being useless kernel hacking. Spent the most time on this one, learned nothing I didn't already know and ended up dropping this grade anyway. ADVICE: If you take this course and ace the first three HWs don't even waste a single minute on this one",

The second test focused on content from the second half of the semester. The weekly reflections involved briefly summarizing key points and insights related to the past week\u2019s content and asking lingering questions. The problem sets were each around 5-7 free-response questions related to the course content and at the time, were graded by completion rather than accuracy to encourage using it as study material while being less punitive (which I really appreciated). The only exceptions were the two MIPS programming homework we also had (separate from the programming assignment). The MIPS assignment at the time was to implement binary tree depth-first traversal \u2013 admittedly, I wasn\u2019t great at MIPS at the time and didn\u2019t finish. The exams (one mid-semester and the other on the last class meeting of the semester) felt fairly representative of the course content for the two halves of the class, and the difficulty felt relatively fair, so long as you studied sufficiently (I didn\u2019t). For each of these, I would heavily recommend reviewing the homework questions and possibly finding questions similar to them, as the exams\u2019 questions felt similar to these. Also check over potentially making minor mistakes when taking the actual test, as that was one of the pitfalls I fell into when I took the course back then. For the course\u2019s weighting, it felt relatively balanced considering the content of the work that counted for each portion, though I will say I would have liked it if the programming assignment had less weight. On average, I\u2019d say I spent 10-15 hours per week on the class, leaning towards the heavier end when we were in the MIPS unit."

The midterm had a low average, but felt like it was a fair difficulty and was doable as long as you understood most concepts at a baseline level. The coding assignment was assigned from Friday to Tuesday before Thanksgiving break and was difficult, but there were no surprises in the grading, i.e. no unseen test cases. Exams weren't cumulative, which was also extremely helpful, since there isn't a direct connection between the first and second half of the content.

The course teaches an introduction to digital logic and computer hardware fundamentals and she caters the material flawlessly making it digestible whether this is your first time seeing these concepts or not. During the past two years she live streamed the class and saved recordings for students to follow along. Homeworks were a bit time-consuming but covered the material taught in class and gave you great practice for the exams which were very similar questions. I would say she is a very fair instructor and grader, and the material and questions she poses are quite interesting and help you gain more insight into lower-level CS. I strongly recommend her for a fundies instructor.",

So I relied on the TAs a lot! My TA was amazing and he was willing to overlook tiny errors for most of my assignment. He also helped me a lot to figure out how to approach the problems. Honestly, if you are planning on taking this course, when doing the problem sets, figure out how to approach each of the questions. Like what info to look out for in the questions and how to use them and things like that. \nMore about prof would be that she is a nice person but she really doesn't seem to care about how much pressure she puts on the student. Like the quizzes which make up one of the largest parts of your grade, she gave only 20 mins. When we requested more time, she just seemed to turn us down. Not just that, often time it seemed like she dismissed our feedbacks. In fact, she specifically mentioned she wants the time pressure. But she replied to her emails within a week. However, I was often redirected to the TA's instead. \nHowever, I have to admit I liked the class structure now that I am done with the class. The workload was evenly distributed in a way that it was impossible to fall behind on the content unless u give up on the class. Also loved how we went from bits and logic to eventually MIPS how codes actually languages like C and java to bits into MIPS and then binary. Like the progression was PERFECT! really tied everything in. \nWord of caution: DO NOT POST QUESTIONS ON SITES LIKE CHEGG OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. Don't even use it. Lots of students got in trouble for this. Go to TA's instead, or ask a friend. My friends were really helpful.",

Her lecture notes/slides are almost useless for completing her practice sheet questions, and she absolutely will not give you any advice/hints on piazza. Instead, she just shuts you down and sometimes deletes piazza posts out of \"academic integrity\" concerns. It's a bit ridiculous/neurotic honestly. \nThe worst part by far is how she DELIBERATELY adds hard/trick questions to the practice sheets, just to make them harder and bring down the class average. Because her lecture notes are almost unusable for understanding the practice problems, you basically have to meet with your TA and teach yourself the material from the book. Her teaching style is incredibly strange, in that I feel she intentionally leaves out important details in order to \"make room\" for the harder problems. Thus, you have to look up/teach yourself the concepts she deliberately left out in order to complete the practice sheets. Luckily, my TA was incredibly good, and I credit them with actually teaching me the material from this course. \nI have no issues with intentionally adding harder problems into the practice sheets, but it should be done in such a way as to enhance student learning. With Kim, she does it simply to make things more of a challenge, and nothing else. There is literally no other purpose to adding these \"trick question\" type problems that make you spend hours and hours trying to figure them out. This instructor also constantly corrects herself, to the point where I wonder if she actually understands what she's saying.\nI hate to be so negative, she's a nice person and all, but she should really change her approach to teaching. It seems she's VERY worried about her class being \"too easy\". Instead, she should approach teaching with the end goal of enhancing student learning.",

I can tell she's passionate about the material she teaches, but unfortunately, she suffers from glossing over/oversimplifying important concepts and underestimating the importance of specific details in order to properly complete her problem sets (she calls them practice sheets). Her lectures are only useful for understanding the material from a \"big picture\" perspective but are not very good for developing a more refined base of knowledge needed to complete the problem sets. The problem sets often draw upon information/concepts that were only given a few moments of time during a lecture, (if at all), but really needed to be addressed in more depth in order to complete the problem(s). There are frequent oddball type questions that, again, are there simply to make the class/problem set more difficult. To do well, you should meet with your assigned TA as often as possible, and read the book.\nDue to her teaching style, it seems she designed the class to make it harder than it really needs to be, just for the sake of making it hard! This makes getting full credit for the problem sets quite difficult and doing them becomes quite arduous and very frustrating. Learning basically becomes a chore with this instructor.\nShe is also incredibly unaccommodating for specific personal issues you may have encountered/experienced as a result of the pandemic/online only learning, as \"she wants to be fair to the rest of the class\". I found this incredibly strange, as we are in the depths of a global pandemic, but I suppose each instructor is entitled to grant or deny these types of requests based on their own judgemental standards.\nRegardless of her drawbacks, I did enjoy this course, especially the last half when MIPS programming is taught and tied into the concepts of the earlier half. Everything comes together very nicely, and you do get a good idea of how all the individual components/concepts you learned fit into the greater whole of the class.",

She lectures pretty clearly and has a solid grasp of the material. She was also very nice and had some funny quirks in class! Since we were all taking the course virtually, she decided to split the class into three components: reflections, homework and quizzes. She kept a very consistent schedule with a reflection and homework due every week (with the exception of breaks), and quizzes (administered on CourseWorks) about every 2 weeks. I would say this was a very effective way to spread all of the points in the class out without having any make-or-break exams/projects during a semester that I'm sure has been difficult for everyone involved. Professor Kim and the TAs ran a very well organized and responsive Piazza. I was very appreciative that there are at least some professors that are taking into account that the semester isn't a normal one.\nThat being said, there were some parts of the class that weren't so great. While I think Professor Kim's lectures were clear, they sometimes seemed disconnected from the homework given to us. While the majority of each week's homework was easy to get most of the problems done, it was very hard to get full credit, as there were a good amount of curveballs thrown. They seemed either completely random or too complicated for the level at which the lectures were presented. Many times, at the end of the semester, it was easy to misinterpret the question and approach the problem incorrectly. However, my TA was very helpful and I probably wouldn't have as good of a grade in my class without him. A few (Not many! But a few) quiz questions weren't super clear and could easily lead to getting the question wrong.\nBut, with all that being said, I learned a lot and I would definitely recommend taking Professor Kim's class!

                "content": "I took it in the Fall 2019 Semester. I was shopping and after reading all the comments, I had my mouse on the drop while taking her first class, but something changed. She turned out to be a really good lecture, and I ended up taking the course. I thought she did an excellent job in teaching the material. This being said, I owe a good chunk of my A- to my TA, Stanly. He was an amazing TA and gave a week-long (each day 12 hrs) of TA OH during finals week. As for Martha, she was still a very great lecture and I feel conveyed her point. She noticed in Piazza that people still struggled in certain topics, but she went over them again during the review session, which really helped. I recommend you keep track of the review session material because, at least in my semester, she tested on them. All of this being said, even though I loved her as a lecturer, the class was a sh*t show after the midterm. It got entirely overly complex and I couldn't understand what was going on. I had a near-perfect score in the midterm, so that is telling you something. I asked around, and people were lost as well. Before the midterm, she would spend a lecture or majority of a lecture on simpler stuff, but after the midterm would spent the exact same amount of time on very complex diagrams such as processors. I found the processors stuff very difficult. My recommendation is to read the book regarding those sections (MIPS, Processors) before class. The book did a great job in explaining them, wayyyyy better than she did. Because of this, I went from scoring near perfect on the midterm to terrified of getting a C or worse in the final, but the TA, Stanly, did a week-long OH during finals week where he offered OH from 8 am to 8 pm. He was a legend and I owe my A- to him. I went from barely understanding anything post-midterm to being confident with one day of his help. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to make sure you understand the practice exams by heart. I found most of the P-set problems hard so didn't bother to do them, some did, they said it helped. Up to you if you want to do them. I recommend you also go to the weekly recitation session because it is both an easy 30% grade for the class and also because it is a great way to ask questions on anything you are lost in. ",

                "content": "Writing this as an update since the course has apparently changed a lot since the last reviews. Basically, now there are 8 problem sets but they aren't turned in or graded, and your grade is based entirely on your midterm, final, and attendance to optional recitation sections. Because of the optional problem sets, I mostly blew off this class. I did virtually no work besides a day or two before the exams, and just crammed then. I missed class a decent amount (especially after the midterm) whenever I had a lot of other work. When I did go, I was not very focused and didn't take notes.\r\n\r\nIn general, though, the class was fine. It was relatively easy and I got a fine grade despite blowing it off. The material is interesting at times, but often it felt like we weren't going into enough depth to really learn much. Lectures were decent but often I felt like Prof Kim would touch on many topics briefly (for example, different kinds of circuit components beyond the basic ones) without going in-depth, so it felt like she was lecturing on things that we didn't really have to know. Since we wouldn't go that deep into topics, I often found the problems she gave in problem sets were either very easy or were too difficult to really understand based only on what she taught in class.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the course covered basic circuit stuff, with combinational and sequential circuits building up to Mealy and Moore machines. The second half covered MIPS and then 3 sample MIPS microarchitectures that show how a processor actually works. \r\n\r\nThere were 8 recitation sections, and they felt pretty much useless. The sections are meant to go over questions from each week's problem set, but mine met the day after the problem sets were released so literally no one had done them. I would guess that even on other days, most people didn't do the problem sets. You could probably get more out of the recitation sections if you kept up with the problem sets and asked questions, but I basically went and zoned out for an hour. The TA wasn't great either, he had a decent command of the material but sometimes couldn't answer questions, and he had taken the course with a different professor who emphasized different parts of the material.\r\n\r\nRecitation attendance is optional, but helps your grade. If you attend all 8 recitations, your grade is 30% recitation attendance (which is effectively 100) and 70% from your exam grades. If instead you attend 4/8, you get 15% of your grade from recitation, and 85% would be based on your exams. This is pretty nice, but the actual grades are just based on a curve of the raw grades, and most people attend most of the recitations (mean attended was like 6.5), so the actual affect on the grades is probably kind of modest. I think the curve was pretty nice, probably like median B+. I did pretty well on the midterm exam and basically average on the final and got a decent grade, so can't complain since I put very little effort into the course.\r\n\r\nOverall, it sounds like the course is much easier than it used to be. You can get by with minimal effort, though you won't really get that much out of the course.",

Mostly, I had to either be very alert and think as fast as I could during class to understand what was going on the slides, or accept the fact that there weren't exams anyway so we didn't have to understand things but think about how I might need to know those concepts to do the projects.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more productive for us to learn approaches to building circuits, rather than only show us extremely advanced examples. The examples gone through during class were intimidating and misleading in their complexity and tediousness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although Kim started out as a terrific lecturer, this class ended up crushing dreams and was a terrible decision. I don't recommend it.",

                "content": "The last few reviews have hit the nail on the head. Don't be fooled by only 6 problem sets and no exams. I looked at earlier reviews, thinking the course wouldn't be too heavy. I was completely blind-sided by the workload. The standout positive aspect of the course were the TAs which were all absolutely fantastic and much more helpful than everything else, slides, lectures, and textbook. I spent about 2x the average time at TA hours in this course, as it was practically mandatory to complete some of the assignments. I NEEDED to attend OH to get anything above 0. I wasn't the only one with this approach as there were regularly 30 people there, clogging up that small TA room, and resulting in a 2 hour wait to talk to a TA for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nLike others have said, projects 1-4 were okay. After project 4 I thought surely this is the toughest it can get, omg how wrong that was. Project 5 and 6 went off the rails with difficulty. Maybe not for a hardware engineering major, but for CS students seeing this stuff for the first time, yikes. It's also important to note the TA's reactions to the different projects, most were excellent from projects 1-4 and it seemed almost elementary to them. This broke down a little on 5 and 6, I could tell some of them were less confident in the material. Not to mention one project was given to the TAs same time as students!!\r\n\r\nThe problem sets completely dominated my semester. I could do nothing else while one wasn't completed. To add insult to injury, putting 30+ hours into an assignment can still result in a 0 regardless of how close you are to a working solution. The prompts are purposely vague and requirements could be boiled down into one sentence, which meant going to office hours just to understand what was required. The assignments are generally all frustrating, often operating on a single crux. If you got it, the rest was easy and you'd get a top score, if you didn't get it, chances are you got a 0.\r\n\r\nTA grading was black and white, except for some edge cases. If you miss something small and obvious that has no bearing on your understanding of the material, nor the focus of the particular assignment, you're getting a zero.\r\n\r\nAll of this wouldn't matter if the material was super useful for your career, but for the majority of CS majors who will be doing software development, this course doesn't return much in practical skills. The MIPS programming is an exception to this and is by far the most valuable thing you will learn.",

                "content": "Martha is a great lecturer. When she speaks in class it's generally very easy to follow and the subject material is always very interesting so it's easy to be engaged. She's also very good about taking questions and stopping and going back to review places where people have indicated confusion. The same goes for her office hours. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to her office hours. Even if the people there have questions that you're already clear on it's always illuminating listening to her explain concepts. She really goes out of her way to try and help the students that come to her office hours. Like, I've been there at its peak where there are 20+ people in a small office space and she's taking questions and explaining them painstakingly and patiently or she's on her knees since she's offered all her chairs to her students and she's reading a massive circuit to try and troubleshoot some edge-case bug. Truly, she's a great professor.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the way the class is organized is a bit uncomfy. The project-orientedness is nothing new for a CS class but the way that they're graded can leave a lot of work unrewarded. At the very least, it's all entirely objective for better or for worse. The good news is you can typically accurately calculate what you're going to get. The bad news is it's very hard to argue a better score later. Any distribution in score comes from optimization whether it's from gate count or CPI. However, if you fail her entry cases it comes to a 0 regardless of how close you got or the optimization algorithm beyond it. Coming very close to having a working circuit and submitting an empty file will get you the same score which is something that's really harsh.\r\n\r\nThe first 4 projects ranged from easy to doable; averages were in the 90s. The distribution really came from the final 2 projects that were centered around CPI optimization so the averages were in the 60-70 range. \r\n\r\nAll this being said, I still highly recommend this class with Martha. Even though the grading scheme feels a little unfair at times, you really do learn a lot from a great professor. Also, so long as you get a working circuit that passes her entry cases you don't have to worry about getting a 0. The material forces you to think critically and is very engaging. I found even when I wasn't working on the projects I wished that I were. ",

                "content": "I dare say that taking this course with Prof. Kim was one of the WORST decisions I've ever made here at Columbia. I won't overgeneralize and state that such was the case for everyone, but I do know that a lot of my peers who were also enrolled in the course had a hard time.\r\nIf you're considering taking this class, please note that she changed the organization of the course entirely starting last fall (Fall 2016), getting rid of exams and giving grades only based on the projects that were given out throughout the semester (6 for Fall 2017, 4 for Fall 2016).\r\n\r\nJust to share a few things about my experience:\r\n- I wouldn't say she's a bad lecturer, but she's not a great lecturer either (as some of the older posts suggest).\r\n\r\n- Lectures were less and less helpful as the course progresses, which is bad since the projects get much harder, especially for the last two.\r\n\r\n- How you perform on the projects do not reflect your level of understanding about the material. You can still end up with bad scores and ultimately a bad grade even if you have a solid understanding about the theoretical concepts, due to lack of experience in circuit implementations.\r\n\r\n- Too much focus on performance and optimization for the latter projects. Functionality does not guarantee full credit; you can still end up with a 0 even if your design works. Sure, I understand performance is important in circuit design and that there should be a means to distinguish those who have put in the work and have performed better than others, but considering that this is an \"intro\" computer architecture class and that most people are using logisim (the circuit simulation program we used in the course) for the first time, I think the grading scheme was too harsh. Doing well in optimization tasks requires a lot of experience, and it wasn't like she provided enough guidance or knowledge for people to cover that up. It was very, very frustrating. \r\n\r\n- Nobody even knows how she calculated the grades in the end. To a question on Piazza asking about the curve and the final grade distribution, she answered: \"I set and do not publish cutoffs as those are my judgement calls and not something that is up for debate/discussion.\"",

Email reply time takes a long time and the administration of the class is poor. The TA review sessions sometimes strayed with TAs solving problems incorrectly. On top of that, the curve is very harsh now; it seems like average was a B- based on my conversations with others who took the class. Style points (+10 to prettiest solutions) skew the curve on efficiency based assignments (since the highest possible grade was in the 60s-70s for both of them but the +10 style points made it as if it was in the 80s). Like before the curve is basically determined by those last two efficiency-based assignments (out of 6) which means consistently good performers got meh or even bad grades for doing average on two assignments out of six.\r\n\r\nOverall, it seems like Kim isn\u2019t taking feedback from students year to year.

We literally spent 60% of the class studying logic of some sort. I would rather have learned more about search algorithms and machine learning. Radev coached the International Linguistics Olympiad team so he's a big fan of linguistics and it shows in his teaching. He spent a lot of time talking about gramamars and outlining NLP at a highly impractical level which I really hated. I think you can learn more about AI by taking a MOOC online from Coursera or Udacity.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 programming projects which are all very time consuming. He gives you 2 weeks for each and they take at least 6-8 hrs. There's no upper limit since you can improve the assignments as much as you want in an effort to get the very generous extra credit (up to 20 points on a 100 point assignment that counts for 20% of your grade). Only 2 of the projects had anything to do with AI. The first one was to be coded in LISP which has the dumbest syntax ever - it's like a poor man's Haskell with a lot of parenthesis.\r\n\r\nAll in all, can't recommend taking this class since it doesn't really cover much. Radev's a nice guy and probably the best teacher for AI you're going to find but the class itself is pointless.\r\n\r\nTests are ok. If you read all the slides you should be fine. If you understand all the algorithms and definitions, you'll do great - there aren't any questions that require a lot of thinking and being clever. He just test how well you know the material. Be warned that some of the slides kind of stink in which case you might want to refer the textbook. Don't waste time reading the entire textbook like he asks you to - it's just a scape goat for him to ask you anything he wants and for you to not complain that it wasn't covered.\r\n\r\nGrading was decently generous.

These review sessions were semi-helpful, and Maria elucidated the worse-written proofs. Still, I sometimes slept through this part a little.\r\n\r\nThe class when I took it was over a third PhD and masters students, so as an undergrad I was pretty intimidated.

Her exams are extremely easy if you study the material at all. However, the course is curved around something, so you expect that something fishy is going to happen. Something very fishy happens. Her TA's begin taking points of for extremely silly things. Oh, did you not detail every tiny step you took to get to the answer? 5 points off. Oh, you didn't name the method you are using to answer the question, even though it's bloody obvious what you're doing? Take 5 more.\r\n\r\nSee my point? The class is curved around how good you are at predicting what random thing they are going to take points off for next. If you are reading this review before taking her class, then you are lucky. You can simply avoid this non-sense by writing down every tiny detail, just to be on the safe side. \r\n\r\nIf you do talk to her, as I've heard many people have done, you will not get the slightest sympathy. Not that I expect any, since I understand she cares nothing about what I think. But there's something cold about the way she talks and looks at you, that reminds me particularly of a venomous snake. Anyway, I digress. Just don't bother talking to her or her TA. He's this snooty French guy, who despises you stupid Americans.\r\n",

It turns out, this class was extremely difficult. Not in the sense that AP is difficult because there's a lot of tricky content, but rather due to how disorganized the class was run logistically. The class feels like getting a ton of fragmented content thrown at you each week, and your job is to figure out how to make sense of it all and organize it into something that makes sense. It's like if you have 1000 necklaces tangled together and you have to untangle them all. This is frustrating because it takes your focus away from actually learning about database systems and makes you waste your time on organizing lecture content. Professor gets upset at how low the lecture attendance rate is on zoom and in-person combined, which is valid. At the same time, the low attendance reflects the sentiment shared by a lot of students in the class that the lectures are incoherent and thus unhelpful. We learn more about the content if we spent lecture time teaching ourselves instead of watching the lecture. Having finished the core of the cs major and multiple cs electives too, I can confidently say this is the worst CS class I've taken. A schedule of assignments is posted on the first week of class, but we deviated from the schedule starting with assignment 1. It's really tough to plan your workload ahead of time, because it's common that the assignments are announced by surprise. Deadlines for the homework are often pushed back if many students ask for extensions, but this results in unpredictable deadlines for future assignments. Professor had said that we will get at least 2 weeks of time to complete each assignment, but due to all the extensions, we only had 1 week to complete the last homework assignment, which was released during the last week of class (aka when many finals are scheduled on the last day of class, and when we also had to study for this class' final exam). I had heard previously that the only downside to this class was the Professor is a little bit disorganized. I had thought, how bad could that possibly be? I can handle a bit of disorganization. If you're thinking that too, I implore you to take databases with any other professor. This level of disorganization results in unimaginable, unnecessary difficulty for students. To put my review into context, I received an A in the class. Yet I am tempted to audit databases by another professor next semester to better learn the content.",

Unfortunately, Professor Ferguson\u2019s style (both teaching and otherwise) just doesn\u2019t work for me.\n\nFirst, his teaching style: I realized during the very first lecture that I\u2019d benefit more from watching them online. But even watching his 2.5-hour-long lectures on 2x wasn't very productive, so I settled for just reading the lecture slides and textbook. But even that was quickly replaced by just skimming through them. I could get by with just skimming the notes because the homework was very easy, and googling whatever concepts you needed was far more efficient. This way of learning helped me do well (enough) in the class, but I honestly don\u2019t feel like I learned what I was supposed to.\n\nNext, the overall course management was extremely stressful and felt inconsiderate. I didn\u2019t know anyone in class, so I intended to rely on Ed for help. But they fostered an environment where asking questions was discouraged. TAs randomly decided which posts to respond to, and most answers were vague or unhelpful. The professor sometimes responded rudely or mocked students for asking dumb questions, which made me very hesitant to post anything myself. He would make big announcements in class and never officially announce them on Ed. And they weren't very accommodating when asked for things like extensions (at least in my case).\n\nI do want to note that Professor Ferguson is a kind person in general. He cancels class when campus is stressful (protests, police presence, etc.) and frequently asks for feedback for certain things and implements it. But I wish he would make bigger changes in how the class is taught. It was very disorganized and stressful, so only take it if you are okay with ambiguous instructions and confusing teaching staff in exchange for an easy 4000-level CS class.",

He also does not prepare any of the code that he is writing beforehand, causing him to spend 20 minutes at a time trying to figure out what is wrong with the non-functioning code. The rest of the lectures are PowerPoint shows, and he is prone to rambling. I do not recommend showing up to live lectures; he records them, and watching them at 2x speed and jumping around when you need to is MUCH more efficient.\n\nMy impression of the homework was that it was not planned in advance at all. None of the assignments were graded until halfway into the semester. We were told that there would be 5 assignments, and that we would slowly build up a capstone project throughout the semester - this did not happen.

He doxes students and often bullies them on Ed if they ask a question that he's \"clearly explained before\" in one of his incredibly difficult to understand \"lectures\". Well smart ass, if multiple people are asking it, did you really explain it that clearly? Perhaps there is a problem with the way you're teaching?\n\nHe fails students on the spot, but somehow isn't clever enough to detect the hordes of Chinese students that stay up very late to get their homework assignments and exams completed by someone in mainland China and all submit literally the same answers, lol. Office hours are announced a few moments before they are actually held. The content of the course is explained in such a confusing way, you're better off just learning it on your own. Most of it does not relate to the assignments at all.\n\nIf this guy transferred that vindictive energy into making this course better, it would probably be worth taking.\n\nOnly take if you absolutely have to.",

Do you think your manager at work will give you a step-by-step outline of what to do? If you're at an elite organization that solves tough problems in the world (honestly doesn't that sound nicer than being a coding monkey???) then your manager will say, here is the exciting problem - solve it. Your will need to then reach out to people at your organization, do research online, use your brain. Yes, if you're new at a project and your boss is good, you can reach out to your boss AFTER you exhausted the other avenues. Otherwise, why does your boss need you over someone else if they always need to hand-hold you ever step of the way? Professor Ferguson stands in the middle where he provides helper code, provides recorded \"how-to\" examples to get you started, and is always there to help, whenever you ask. I've actually never seen a professor make himself so available to his students. Your manager probably won't even give you as much time! \nIf you're working on something important and novel after school, often there is no one \"right\" answer. Prof. Ferguson involves some such questions on his homework. Yet, instead of being excited, I saw many students get flustered and not know what to do when they are asked to think for themselves. For example, he asked students to create an ER diagram on some data. Students asked him questions such as \"is there a one-to-many relationship for x and y data?\" That is a coding monkey question! Ferguson pushes students to up-level their thinking to that of a best-in-class engineer. For example, the best engineers out there say, \"based on what we are trying to achieve and what data we have, here is my recommendation on how we organize it.\"\nThere are many other points on why Prof. Ferguson is one of the top professors I've ever taken, but I'll leave you with one more. Many professors tell you to memorize some rule, you memorize it, you answer on the test, and then you forget. Professor Ferguson asks you questions where you end up understanding the why and internalize the why. For example, everyone who has taken a databases class knows the different types of data storage, such as a star schema. However, do you actually know how to take some data that is not pristine, wrangle it into a star schema, and then query it? In what cases would you use a star schema over another layout? What data should actually be on what table? How do you take the data from Third Normal Form to a Star Schema? I bet if you didn't take Ferguson's class then you will need your hand held when you start working as you wouldn't actually know the answers.",

The instructions have been removed in order to shorten the exam length. You get another email from Ferguson saying he\u2019s holding office hours 3 minutes before his wedding. A single tear rolls down your cheek. \u201cJust like the industry, you whisper.\"\nLet me give you a quick high school style literary analysis of this passage to help those thinking about taking the class understand better. The author uses hyperbole when they write \"2035\" as a reference to how late many of the assignments, grades, etc. are released despite the teaching staff claiming they will be released the next day. The author then goes on to evoke the pain of setup in this class: \"spending 3 hours figuring out how to install a Python 3 emulator,\" as much of your time will be spent fighting with your computer to just get the software you have to use connected and running. The assignments are very long with many parts, and the instructions are very confusing, a point alluded to in the metaphor that the instructions are almost as if they have been \"removed\". As the author illustrates, office hours do happen at random times and you have to be ready to hop on the call at any time of day, and possibly you too will get the chance to hear about his girlfriend. The author then begins to conclude this masterpiece by emphasizing the visceral emotions one feels through the imagery of a teardrop. This effect is compounded by the author's choice to use the second person throughout the passage. Finally, you are left reminded of Ferguson's constant belief that the undefined aspects of the assignments and acceptance of most solutions as long as they work are \"just like in industry\". By using such evocative imagery, the author, dare I say the artist, is able to capture not just arbitrary details, but the human experience of taking Ferguson's class.  \nAll in all, it was a decent but very chaotic and time-consuming class.",

                "content": "He's a good professor and once you actually get to know him, a nice guy, but the class itself is a total disorganized mess. I can understand how challenging it would be to design an introductory class based on basic database/SQL concepts because, well, it's not all that challenging, to begin with. SQL really isn't a programming language at all and it's very easy to learn. Basic concepts like \"data cleanup\" and writing the correct SQL query to get the data you want are really not all that hard. Basically, he could spend two or three weeks running through a few examples of various SQL queries/terms, show everyone how to set up basic database software, run through a few basic definitions from the textbook, and that would be the entire class. \nBecause he does not want to run the class this way, (not to mention it would be far too short), you're basically stuck having to google your way through the majority of the class to teach yourself the concepts that were given very little, if any, time in a lecture. Going to the various TA office hours becomes mandatory as well. \nThus, much of his lectures are \"filler\" material that hardly pertains to the class assignments/homework at all. You'll often find yourself saying: \"Well, that was nice to know and quite interesting, but how does this relate to the class assignments?\" Well, it doesn't, because again, the basic concepts of this class are not really all that hard and can be explained in a few weeks, so he fills each class with things that are certainly database related, but are not useful at all for doing the homework. Again, from a class design perspective, I can see why he does this, but it makes going to the lectures tedious and incredibly boring. \nThe main problem with this professor is how INCREDIBLY long the assignments take.  You'll spend hours on google and working with the TA's to complete the overly long assignments not only because you'll have to teach yourself how to do them, but also trying to resolve the various technical/error messages that will arise as you do the assignments. I think I spent more time trying to resolve various error messages in MySQL Workbench than I did learning about databases.\nOh, and the midterm was one of the most stressful experiences of my entire life, mainly because of the way he phrases/asks the questions. The way he words the questions are so ambiguous that you'll be on piazza constantly looking for clarification on whether your approach to the question is correct or not. Doing the assignment involves knowing lots of SQL and getting your queries to run right. To make things more frustrating, every question has a subpart, and those subparts have subparts, so the entire exam is VERY long. The entire assignment took me somewhere in the range of 30+ hours and it was a disaster. \nAlso, when do you want clarification on a specific question, you'll find that you get different answers from different people. If you ask Prof. Ferguson, he'll give you one answer, but the head TA will give you a different answer, and another TA will give you a totally different answer, and maybe another TA will tell you something else entirely. Basically, you'll quickly discover that nobody really knows what is going on or has any idea how to resolve the issues you/the large majority of the class are having, so you'll just become even more confused. Making annotations that accompany the answers you give in the assignments is basically mandatory because nobody really knows what is going on.\nI hate to be so negative, as he's a nice guy and all, but by the end of the class, I think he realized just how much of an absolute and total mess this class turned out to be and just gave the large majority of the class an A.

He was also very available: he held in-person or video office hours all the time, especially near homework or exam deadlines. Also, all of his lectures and online OH were videoed and posted to Courseworks.\r\n\r\nI got the impression taking this class that other sections may be more focused on theory than practice - in this section, most of the homework (and lectures) were focused on how to work with databases than learning database theory. We did spend some time on theory, but as little as Professor Ferguson thought he could get away with, which I really liked. Most of the semester was spent learning SQL, but we spent some time on relational algebra, a little bit of time on graph databases toward the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the homeworks were programming projects in python, using pymysql. Time consuming, but certainly doable and taught me a lot. There was sometimes some ambiguity in the project guidelines, which generated a lot of questions on Piazza, but I think the consensus from Professor Ferguson and the TAs was that you could make whatever design decisions you thought were wise, as long as you included your rational in the README. Basically, I thought the assignments and grading were very fair. Later homeworks (and both exams) were turned in in the form of jupyter notebooks, and a lot of the lectures were available for download in that format; it was a bit of a pain to set up at first but absolutely necessary. Components of some homeworks were also to submit complex SQL queries.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ferguson was also just really understanding and adaptable to different circumstances. If you really need an extension, he will almost certainly grant it. Also willing to listen to student feedback in general: when I took the class (fall 2019) Professor Ferguson used a baseball database for an in-class example nearly the entire semester and as the database for several homeworks. I personally didn't mind this, but some students found the specific terminology to be confusing. Professor Ferguson took this into account and said he would not plan to use this database in the same way in future semesters.",

He asked for a lot of our feedback and drastically restructured how he taught later in the semester. Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect. But the fact of the matter is that he went through a world of effort to make the class better for his students. \r\n\r\nThere was also some confusion pertaining to assignments, but I think that will be refined over time. Also, his office hours were incredibly helpful. He would make extra office hours in the weekend to help students.

Though I tried to get clarification both through emails and office hours, the emails did not necessarily help as following those responses led to point deductions and despite scheduling appointments at office hours the teacher was late.  It would have been helpful to get the test cases for the programs so that we could determine whether or not our programs correctly solved the problems.  The project guidelines were very ambiguous, and despite trying to get a feel for the \"creativity\" and \"originality\" for my project before I dove into it I was not able to learn much.   In my opinion  if we complete or at least reasonably attempt our proposal (with guidance from the instructor of course) then we should receive very high marks on the project.  The project should have been about finding something that was original, interesting, and useful to you.  However, the instructor failed to respond to emails about problems that I was having with the project and seemed to give the impression that he would dock points for our projects not being \"original\", though this is very subjective.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the reason I took this class was to learn python - being required to turn in the assignments forced me to do that, though I don't necessarily attribute anything that I learned about python to being in class.  Rather the direction that the assignments pushed you forced you to learn python yourself through both trial and error and online tutorials.  Given that the workload in the class was definitely more than it should have been for a one credit course, I probably would have been better simply teaching myself python over break.",

First time teaching.\r\n\r\nNot the greatest teacher in my opinion; but for the first time teaching, not the worst. He stated repeatedly that he was limited by the lecture notes, that he was told by the Professor Gross to go straight from his lecture notes. Which he did. He did a decent number of examples, but he didn't do them very well, i.e. skipped a lot of steps. The concepts didn't really stick. If you wanted something clarified, however, he was very good at answering questions.\r\n\r\nThe things he covered in class often carried over to the test, but never to the homework. What the lectures were doing and what the book/homework emphasized were completely different. They didn't have much overlap.\r\n\r\nHe had abnormal ways of going about tests. He experimented with different ways to do review sessions over the web, i.e. TokBox, Google Wave. It was effective enough, I suppose. He answered the questions that people came up with, but it wasn't as easy to understand; it would've been easier if he did it on a chalkboard. Additionally, the way he grades: if you improve from the first test to the second test by at least 15 points, he'll take the higher of the two. But if you had higher on the first than the second, he won't change the scores. If he is your teacher, I would recommend going to class. Looking at the lecture notes tends not to be enough: he'll go into tangents, which he'll end up testing.\r\n\r\nHaven't taken the final, but it seems he plans to curve to either a B+ or an A-.\r\n\r\nHe has a tendency to go a bit too much into his personal life. He's also always telling you good courses to take.",

I originally was worried that it would be too advanced for me since I didn't take w1004 and I felt inexperienced with programming especially after half a year of not touching java, but when I told Adam Cannon (the 1004 prof) that I'd already gotten a 4 on the AP CS exam, he told me to take w1007 instead which led me here.\r\n\r\nSwap is a pretty good teacher, and a really great person.  The classes were fun and there was just a chill atmosphere there.  He programmed things like cheezburger cats and harry potter creatures.  I think it was structured pretty well, and it really helped me better understand OOP, especially since my teacher from my AP class in high school was pretty bad at explaining the concepts of inheritance, and words like static/final/public/private. At the same time though, I will also say that sometimes the class went off track or just really slowly (some of the stuff covered in the AP apparently wasn't taught to the 1004 class), so I spent a lot of classes coding for the hw assignments. I didn't have to take many notes... I feel like the textbook is pretty easy to read so it's easy to just look up what you need to know if you forget something.\r\n\r\nHomework took a lot of time to complete, but I thought all the assignments were pretty fun and the grading is straightforward. I think the best advice I have is to not wait until the last moment for starting your assignments. Instead, start them as early as possible. That way, when you run into problems, you have time to go to TA office hours. My TAs were amazing and super helpful, and I really don't know what I would have done without them.  I feel like with all the help offered, there really is no reason to not do well in this class, unless you procrastinate and just don't do the work or hand it in late. I'm not even that great at time management, but I still got an A in this class.  There's a lot of opportunities for extra credit and the midterm & final aren't hard as long as you look over the code from class and know your vocab.\r\n\r\nBasically this class gave the confidence to keep pursuing CS as my major. Yes, there were a lot of all nighters, but I enjoy coding all night (it kind of gives me a coding high? haha) so it was partially by choice. Do the work, and you'll be fine!",

He is totally willing to chat with students during office hours or whenever you need him, and the class environment is super relaxed. However, I was really disappointed in this class. Here's why.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, I will mention that I took 1004 last semester and did quite well. Consequently, much of the material we covered in 1007 was pointless review for me (inheritance, interfaces, etc.). Worse, Swap is not a good lecturer\u00e2\u20ac\u201chis classes wander aimlessly, guided by broad topics and students' questions. It was much more efficient for me to read the textbook (readily available in PDF form) rather than listen to his lectures, and then use Big Java to review older material.\r\n\r\nHis homeworks were a mixed bag. Some were quite helpful: the GUI project was especially instructive. Others were incredibly stupid. One assignment involved crawling the HTML of various Wikipedia pages about the Academy Awards and retrieving data (e.g., who won the 1993 Best Actress award, stuff like that). Is HTML parsing useful? Yes, but this assignment literally took 20+ hours of tedious drudgery, because all of the Academy Awards pages are formatted completely differently from each other. Moreover, it didn't really seem relevant to what we learned in the class; the networking involved is extremely simplistic, no graphics, no interfaces, etc. Another assignment involved making a command-line (textual) version of Othello. Again, extremely tedious. Why not just wait to do the Othello assignment until after we had learned graphics programming? \r\n\r\nThe good news is that the topics are useful and important: graphical user interfaces, networking, interfaces, inheritance, file input/output, etc.\r\n\r\nThe exams were really easy. The average was ~80 for the midterm and final. As a result though, there was presumably almost no curve. I got a B+, which felt a little harsh considering how well I did in the class (81 midterm, 90 final, 92 homework average). I was honestly expecting an A.\r\n\r\nThis course is no longer required for the CS major if you've already taken 1004, and I don't recommend taking both. If you have to take it, go ahead\u00e2\u20ac\u201cit's not hard, and some of the things you learn are really helpful, but it's often frustrating.",

                "content": "Disclaimer: I got one of the highest grades in the class. Don't think about that, however. It doesn't matter. I can promise you I objectively didn't do any better or worse than most of the people in the class. However, it stands to be asserted what a horrific failure Swapneel and his TA's were in teaching this class and how much it needs to ring out, loud and true, across every desktop of every student who is even thinking about registering for ASE under him.\r\n\r\nBe objective for a minute. Look at the other reviews for this class. All of them are negative. Only two people disagreed (perhaps the teacher himself and a TA?). What does that tell you? Ignore your feelings for a minute and let's focus on the facts. Looking at the other reviews and the overwhelming agreement that \"Swapneel\" and \"ASE\" should NEVER mix.................what does that tell you?\r\n\r\nIt tells you to fucking drop this class before you make the same mistake I did, you stupid fuck. Why? Read on....\r\n\r\nYes, it's a core class. You've got to take four. However, at least take a class where you will actually learn something. ASE is not that class. You will learn no new tools or technologies to aid you as a programmer. Software engineering as shown in this class is perhaps the most worthless and the lowest common denominator of computer science; if you can even call software engineering a science. I have no respect for anybody who seriously considers themselves computer scientists and decides to study software engineering as a specialization. I can sum up the entire class in two sentences. Ready? \"Before you program a piece of software, take the time to plan it out and get an idea of what is needed and wanted. Then, after design and implementation take place, write lots of test cases to make sure everything works smoothly and correctly.\" That's it. I'm fucking serious. That's fucking Advanced Software Engineering. It makes me shudder to think of what regular \"software engineering\" is. EVERYTHING - and I mean EVERYTHING - you learn in this class can easily be picked up by landing a job and staying there for a little while. You are ABSOLUTELY wasting your tuition taking this class because - mark my words - you will eventually learn all of this material for free. There is no justification possible to convince me that the several grand I wasted on this class was worth it; there is no fitting label for this class other than \"complete and utter rip off\". Even if you take this review and the others with a grain of salt, I can promise you the class is still a waste of time because it's a fucking tautology you'll be learning this stuff anyway.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to Swapneel and his merry men whom are the real reasons why you should avoid taking this class. Yes, even REALER than what I've mentioned above. Swapneel is approachable in class and outside of class. He responds to emails semi-frequently and the TA's were very available as per their office hours. This is all nice and fine but just because you do the bare minimum of what you are supposed to do doesn't and will NEVER make you a good TA and especially not a good teacher.\r\n\r\nI'll start with Swapneel's waiver policy. Once people effectively saw through him, many people tried to waive this class and nearly all of them were met with rejection. Don't ask me why. I can understand a few people here and there leaving due to the material not interesting them; rejecting a flood of people from waiving the class just to cover your own ass and to heavy-handedly \"legitimize\" your material is not only suspicious but a move worthy of only the most supreme of dicks. For this alone you have my eternal contempt.\r\n\r\nNext, the grading. Every assignment and lecture for that matter was excessively vague which is a stunning accomplishment for Swapneel given that just about everything in this class is complete fucking common sense. It was evident from the beginning of the semester that Swapneel had absolutely no idea what he was doing and, for many topics, no idea what the fuck he was talking about. The TA's were even worse with the material with the exception of Jon Bell. Jon Bell knew his stuff, but he is the special breed of asshole TA who likes to answer your questions with condescending questions of his own in order to, if I had to guess, feed his pretentious ego and perhaps make him feel better about excelling in perhaps the most worthless field of computer science. There was nothing about his actions that anybody could have mistaken for productive in a million years. I would pay Jon a visit from time to time asking for clarifications on grading or assignments in general and would be subjected to a barrage of condescension, pretentious remarks, and general smuggery. I eventually quit going to his office hours because I found his behavior so thoroughly revolting, disgusting, and perhaps most importantly, counterproductive. The other reviewers have touched on the other important aspects of the grading; generally the loss of points for unmentioned phenomena in the rubrics and the subjective, smug nature of the points. I won't bother to repeat what has already been said aside from the following: even if you think you've covered every possible angle of your assignment, you haven't. You have to look for the one stupid unmentioned detail that they're going to fuck you on and hammer that shit out otherwise you stand to lose points big time. If they ask for a test case, create multiple test cases. If they want a thorough explanation, give them an assload of words. If they want an example of something, include the example and a counter example. That's the mindset I had to take in order to get the grade I did in this class and I will re-emphasize it: look for the unmentioned details that COULD help you and fucking INCLUDE THEM because otherwise they will screw you out of a shitload of points.\r\n\r\nI'm getting the word out on this shit. Swapneel, Jon, Kunal M, Kunal G, and Priyank, I want you to read the above thoughts again very carefully. If you don't take these words to heart, you are going to destroy your chances of ever being worth a shit in the CS department again in regards to teaching. Not that the damage hasn't been done already; Swapneel and his TAs should NEVER, EVER be allowed to have the job running this class again. I'm fucking serious. You five are the worst I've ever fucking seen. I had a class at my old school with three teachers; a new teacher would come in after a test was given and none of the teachers communicated with one another in regards to what we had already learned. It was completely disorganized and the averages were abysmal since we were repeatedly tested on things the teacher thought we knew but we hadn't actually covered. All three of them were unapologetic in their grading policies and, when they didn't finish covering the units they were supposed to, told us to figure out the material ourselves and one of them even told the class to accept an solution of his \"based on good faith\" when he couldn't solve an example problem after two classes. You five were fucking worse than that class. The absence of this class is better than it's presence with you five at the helm, and just about anybody would be better at running this class than any of you ever would. You five are a disgrace to the department and I hope these words come back time and time again to forcibly separate you all from ever having the chance to teach again. Harsh? Swap, you once mentioned your grading policies mirrored the real world. Well, mine don't get any realer than this.\r\n\r\n",

Instructing staff was lazy and did not put any effort in making assignments or deciding the grading criteria, which can help students learn something. At times I wondered if  I was undertaking a core courses at one of the best computer science departments of the country or participating in a competition called SCORE. I think Swapneel made it mandatory for students to participate in SCORE so that he can improve his own resume and show how many teams instructed by him participated in the competition. This is what happens when you have a PHD students instruct a core course. I don't know how can the SEAS select such an under qualified person to take this course (he is not even a PHD yet!). Most TAs lacked sufficient subject knowledge. Although, Jon has knowledge about subject but he is more occupied with finding ways to screw students grades and feeding his big ego than imparting education. So, think twice before taking a course where Jon is a TA.\r\n\r\nMy advice: Change your track, change your university, drop out of college, do anything but don't take this course.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll views in this review are my personal opinion.   \r\n",

                "content": "Oh dear. I don't even know where to begin.\r\n\r\nConsider this review as a warning to all of you misguided souls who are thinking of taking this class under Swapneel. Consider this review a strong and heavy deterrent such that you may maintain and keep your sanity and save yourself the struggle of taking a class with arguably the worst teacher I've ever encountered in my entire life.\r\n\r\nSure, Swapneel is a nice guy and he's approachable. I'm sure he's great in the other classes he teaches; I don't doubt the accuracy of his other reviews for a second. However, ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THAT APPLIES TO ASE. Swapneel's ideas for this class go from mind-fuck stupid to borderline insane.\r\n\r\nAhem. There are five distinct reasons you don't want to take this class, four of which are a direct result of Swapneel's horrible decisions:\r\n\r\n1. This is a class about software engineering, and you will be doing a lot of busy work. You'll be doing a lot of reading. Now you MIGHT think that would make for an easy A but you would be grossly mistaken for reasons I'll get into in just a second. The material in the class is EXTREMELY boring unless you're actually into this shit. You could seriously learn everything in the class by either reading Wikipedia or holding down a programming job for a little while. The material is definitely not something to spend your tuition on because you are almost certainly going to learn it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. The Midterm. The midterm wasn't exactly difficult (even though the average was in the 60's) but there was a certain stipulation to the grading that didn't make any sense. Each multiple choice question was worth 3 points; missing a question not only cost you the chance at getting those 3 points but you would lose an additional point as well. What's the point? I don't know why Swapneel thought this would be a good idea; it's nonsense like this and the teacher's inability to know unequivocal rock-fuck stupid when the rest of the class sees it that will prove to be his defining hallmark in ASE.\r\n\r\n3. The \"Implementation\" assignment. You spend a good chunk of the class developing a piece of software using the class concepts to guide you along. There is a proprietary repository set up for the class where you can use Git to handle your code and there is also a website called Jira which allows teams to create and document project tasks. The skillful use of both of these tools as well as planning and executing software engineering strategies is crucial to your success and one would think that mastery of these tools and concepts would be critical in the grading of your project. WRONG. The majority of your project grade comes from a subjective analysis by the TAs. In order words, you could program a solid piece of software and demonstrate exemplary skill of all class concepts in getting your work done; however, if the TA's for whatever reason don't like your project, don't think it's cool enough, or you are a bad speaker and don't demonstrate it in a way that would blow their mind then it's going to hurt you. I can understand subjective analysis being a bit player when it comes to grading, but why the fuck do you make it more important than the objective analysis which is far more relevant to the intentions of the class?\r\n\r\n4. The third assignment. The assignment was out of 40 points with additional 20 points of extra credit. The average on the assignment itself was a 17; the average on the extra credit was a 4. Yes, that's a four. Given the horrible midterm average and the average of this assignment, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the class is at fault; that's the mark of a shitty teacher. Furthermore, the TA's took points off for things that weren't even mentioned in the assignment document. For example, part of the assignment required White Box testing on a hypothetical feature of a certain project. The assignment stated that all we had to include was our \"general procedure\" for doing white box testing. The TA who graded me took off points for only writing a \"general procedure\". What gives?\r\n\r\n5. The testing assignment. This one BY FAR is the worst offender and permanently turned me against Swapneel. This is by far the stupidest assignment I've ever done in my life, particularly because of one caveat of the grading. You see, the assignment itself was 200 points with 50 extra credit; 70 points of the 200 dealt with testing other teams' applications. Each team tested two other teams; you could get a maximum of 35 points per team. Before actually performing the testing, each team had to document as many bugs as they could in the aforementioned Jira website used in the class. Documenting a bug meant that it could not be used against you when other teams tested you; however, if a team found a bug that WASN'T documented it not only cost the tested team 2 points but the testing team would gain 2 points. In order to get the full 35 points for the assignment your team had to find 15 undocumented bugs and 10 documented bugs; 1 point per documented and 2 for each undocumented. Your team could not get more than 15 points for documented bugs and 20 for undocumented; even if your team found 40 documented bugs you could only get a maximum of 15 points by virtue of all bugs being documented. Furthermore, each team was only given 30 minutes to test each application. TO RECAP: In order to get a full score on testing a particular team, you had 30 minutes to find at least 25 bugs. Of those 25 bugs, EXACTLY 15 had to be undocumented and 10 had to be undocumented. Is it is easy to see how this is borderline impossible? Congratulations, you have more foresight than Swapneel Sheth. Furthermore, a team could get stuck with an application that had relatively little bugs thus harming their grade due to factors that are impossible to control; when the class was berating him for this possible outcome his only reply was a sheepish \"Yes, it could be unfair, but that's why you get two teams to test.\". The teacher deliberately knew the assignment could be unfair but went ahead with it anyway: if that isn't a mark of poor judgement then I don't know what is. OH....and if you happened to program a perfect application with ZERO bugs then the two teams testing you would get full credit (as long as the TAs couldn't find any either). The team creating the perfect application would get jack shit for having made such a fine specimen of software. I'm not even mentioning the infighting that occurred during the testing phase; the stipulations of the assignment encouraged teams to screw each other over by \"finding\" undocumented bugs and I saw several arguments in the testing room between whether or not so-and-so was a bug. Why the fuck would the teacher think this was a good idea? Does this sound like something you want to be spending your time and tuition on?\r\n\r\nThink about it. Save yourself.

While I liked how he updated his syllabus from the last one, the execution was simply bad. I don't what might have been the issue for him, but after midterms, the course became utterly disorganized. Almost everything was done at the very last minutes. For instance, the videos we were supposed to watch before each flipped classroom sessions were uploaded less than 24 hours prior to my session, making it impossible to studying them thoroughly. And all of the sudden, assignment 3 became analytical part only assignment and assignment 4 became programming part only assignment. While this could a perfectly reasonable thing, but I'm sure I wasn't the only one who felt this was a rushed decision. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Collins is a very knowledgeable man on Natural Language Processing and probably a very nice person.

We were assigned small (10-15 person) sections, and each week had about 60-90 minutes of coursera videos to watch before hand. At the session he would spend 20 minutes recapping the key points from the videos, then maybe 30 minutes we'd be doing questions (very similar to the exam questions), and discussing the answers with him. Lots of opportunities to ask questions and talk with him, especially if you get a less crowded session. (Note that his original plan was that he'd only do 2 of every 3 weeks for each section, and a TA would do the other. However it seemed like he abandoned this after a while, and combined a few sessions so he could do all of them himself.)\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the format. Keeping up with the lectures before your session was a bit difficult when you have a million other things to do, but pretty important. I fell behind about 3/4ths through when we switched away from machine translation, and it took me a while to catch up again. It was also a little disappointing that you almost never saw who else was in the class, since a bit of discussion about the homework with other students was quite valuable. \r\n\r\nThere is no textbook, but he has a set of classnotes online that's basically an alpha version of a textbook, along with the slides he used in the coursera video.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I had with the class was general non-responsiveness on Piazza.

However, the types of questions he asks are mostly of the \"do something with a toy grammar\" type that you're asked in the flipped classrooms.

I enjoyed the class and I'd recommend it. I also wish that every CS professor would switch to flipped classroom.\r\n\r\nEvery week, he assigned about an hour and a half of video lectures from Coursera. These lectures are incredibly clear and the great thing about them being online is that you can watch them 80 times over until you understand the material. I usually space out during CS lectures, so this was invaluable for me. Then you attend a weekly (~10 people) discussion session where you do problems taken from previous exams. This was more like him handing out the questions, everyone staring blankly at them for a few minutes, and him explaining the answers. Repeat for an hour. These discussions were led by him and the TAs, and they usually felt awkward, but they were useful. They were supposed to be mandatory but he stopped taking UNIs after a few weeks, and I don't think they really ended up being mandatory. Toward the end of the semester, a lot of people stopped going. He posted textbook style notes about the lectures as well as classroom questions and solutions online after each week.\r\n\r\nAs someone whose programming skills were rusty and mediocre at best, I found the homework to be challenging but not at all impossible. I recommend using Python, and if you don't know it, it will be easy to learn. For the programming, you're literally just implementing the algorithms that you learned in class, so it's not so much thinking about how to solve the problems as it is deciding what data structures to use and being careful with your code. They were sometimes unusually time consuming though.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were usually pretty helping during office hours, and not as helpful on Piazza. Prof Collins did not hold office hours, and he explained that the flipped classroom would be the time for office hour questions.\r\n\r\nDefinitely come in with solid knowledge of probability. You'll need a little bit of calc and linear algebra toward the end.

He explains topics thoroughly and thoughtfully and takes time during class to answer all questions. He'll give printouts of slides to you as well as post them online. (The slides themselves are really only meant to supplement his lecture though\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are some classes where the slides are a good substitute for in-class notes; this is not the case here.) For some of the bigger topics (part of speech tagging, machine translation, etc.) he'll also type up his own notes that cover the subject pretty well. Overall an approachable and friendly guy. \r\n\r\nAs for the course itself, like a previous reviewer said, Collins definitely brings some rigor to a class that is generally within Julia Hirschberg's realm of teaching. The class felt like applied machine learning at times, and you were at an advantage if you've taken some sort of ML before, and a strong foundation in statistics is important to really understand what's going on. The average on some assignments and quizzes were really low (a third of the class got less than 50% on the second quiz), but the class is curved. The tests were a mix of applying basic knowledge on a topic and adapting algorithms learned in class to some unique situation. The analytical part of the homeworks were generally in a similar spirit. Grading was a bit harsh at first but seemed to let up towards the end. \r\n\r\nIf you know 1) your stats and/or 2) have taken some ML before and 3) want to learn NLP from one of the top people in the field, there's no question you should take this class. If you just want to do #3, it'll take you a little more effort, but you'll probably muddle your way through like the rest of us. If none of these sound interesting, there are better classes out there for you, friend.\r\n",

Like the title suggests, it's about ML applications to NLP, but since just about every machine learning model anyone's come up with has been used for NLP at some point, it tends to focus on problems Collins himself has worked on or is working on now. This is obviously a Good Thing: he was obviously excited about most of the material in the class (I don't think I've ever heard the phrase \"fun algorithm\" used more or with such earnestness) and made it exciting to learn as well.\r\n\r\nHe's a phenomenally clear lecturer---I took this class concurrently with ML, and the contrast between Collins' presentations and Jebara's insane ramblings couldn't be clearer. I'd encountered a couple of the models we talked about in this class before and struggled with them; MC made everything effortlessly comprehensible. The slides are also good enough that you can get away with skipping the assigned papers (though you really shouldn't; I stopped after about two weeks but am hoping to catch up during the summer).\r\n\r\nAt times it felt like half the department was taking the class; other days there were only five people there. Obviously he's a big fuckin' deal, and just about everyone in the NLP group, faculty included, showed up at some point to watch the man himself teach. I'm still not sure how many people there were auditors rather than enrolled students. That said, both he and Vinod were very accessible during OO and by email.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased to see that he's teaching NLP next fall---he'll bring some much-needed rigor to Hirschberg's class (which is well-intentioned but a little fuzzy around the edges).

I'm not a CS major and the only other programming course I took was intro to programming in Java, over two years ago.  I wanted to learn Python since it's a pretty hot language and would be useful in my own research and nice to put on a resume.  That's pretty much Ang's philosophy, he assumes everyone is in the class because they want to use Python for something or another, not because they have to take the class.  Ang is super cool, always available to help, and he gave a lot of people extensions.  (In fact I think he gave the whole class a week long extension on the final project.)\r\n\r\nThe lectures and slides, as he admits, are basically telling you the same thing that the tutorial on Python.org will tell you.  So you don't really need to come to lecture, especially if you have a solid CS background.  Not having such a background myself, it was hard for me to follow the lectures, especially the late ones, but luckily it doesn't really matter since you get to choose your final project, so you really only need to worry about understanding the things that you will need to complete your project (which should be the things relevant to what you plan to use Python for anyway).\r\n\r\nThe class was six weeks, there were 3 homeworks: the first two were writing programs from scratch, the third was involved with the project (basically outlining, planning it, and writing the unit tests you plan to use).  The homeworks were really challenging for me because of my lack of background, and the first two took basically a weekend each to complete, but the time was well invested as I did well on all the assignments.\r\n\r\nThe final project was basically anything that would be \"useful in your research\" (of decent enough size and complexity to be called a \"final project\").  One of the most challenging parts of the class, for just about everyone, was figuring out what to do for your final project.  On the one hand it can't be trivial.  On the other hand, since you're essentially assigning yourself a project, you don't want to fuck yourself over with too much work.  If you can find the right balance, you'll probably do well and it won't be too painful.  You also have to give a short presentation of your project either to the class, or to Ang or the TA one-on-one.  Again I spent a lot of time on the project and did really well.\r\n\r\nOverall I'm glad I took the course as what I got out of it was proportional to what I put in, which is how it should be.  ",

She is one of the few profs that lives and works in the real world in the 21st century. She responds to emails right away with helpful answers and is very proactive about helping students. \r\n\r\nShe is a particularly valuable resource thanks to her experience in the NY tech startup scene. She works for 10gen - the creators of MongoDb (which I would recommend over Sql any day)\r\nMoreover, she went above and beyond her Columbia duties. After I dropped the class, we continued to correspond. In the end she inspired me to learn RoR on my own. \r\n\r\nShe is a rare gem and a valuable resource.\r\nHopefully they can figure out a way to get her back next semester. ",

Which is that she is an incompetent teacher w.r.t. teaching concepts that students are not already familiar with. For students with a strong mathematical background, this is no problem, because, as previous reviews have mentioned, this class covers more breadth than depth. But because of the increase in CS majors, there's a corresponding increase in students in the class who haven't had as rigorous a math background. For us, Dawn's explanations leave a lot (everything) to be desired. She frequently backtracks, corrects herself, and equivocates when answering questions, e.g. (in response to a student's question) \"Well, you're right if we're on the same page,\" which is a non-answer, or \"If you're confused just try the practice problems on this at home,\" which defeats the purpose of going to class. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the class seems to be split into students who have seen everything except graph theory before and students who have seen none of it means that, at least this semester, the latter were afraid to ask questions, which Dawn read as comfort with the material rather than confusion about the concepts (and/or the motivation for them). Disappointing, because I feel like the subject could be rewarding as taught by a teacher good at working with large audiences.\r\n\r\nAvoid Dawn's section of this class if you can.",

Professor Strickland will stop to take every question and it's a large class so expect to spend a lot of time listening to things repeated over and over again. The homeworks are pretty easy and all done through CourseWorks so a textbook is not necessary unless you want to do the practice problems she recommends, which are only worth it if you don't have a decent math background because the homework and test questions can all be solved using the same techniques used on examples in class. If you're the kind of person who prefers to read the textbook - just buy it and don't go to class. The tests are pretty easy if you enjoy math and more than enough time is allotted. An honors class in the subject really should be offered but in the meantime, enjoy the easy A if math is your thing.

She is very friendly and approachable and will gladly answer any questions you have. However, I have several gripes with the course (not necessarily with Dawn herself).\r\n\r\nTo start, the textbook for the class is garbage (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen). It's full of convoluted examples with little explanation for how the problems are solved. The information is conveyed in the most elaborate terms, and once the material gets difficult, it is extremely difficult to understand. I think the textbook really needs to be changed. Just check out the Amazon reviews for it: http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0073383090\r\n\r\nSecondly, the optional homework comes straight from the book. I'm certain that almost nobody did it, because (1) it's optional, and (2) the book is no good. There are no quizzes in the class either, so your grade is entirely dependent upon the exams.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dawn's lectures are well-structured and pretty informative. You can learn most of the easier material just by going to lecture. However, once the material got harder, I couldn't understand much of what was going on in class. To study for the exams, I pretty much just Googled what I needed to know from the book and then took her practice exam.\r\n\r\nMy last gripe is this. I actually did well on the exams and got a good grade in the class- however, I cannot say that I know much of anything about Discrete Math. I really don't feel like I learned anything from the course. If you asked me what Discrete Math is and why it's important, I couldn't tell you. I studied in a way that allowed me to do well on the exams for some reason, but I'm still confused about much of the material and really was not satisfied with the course.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, I don't think it's hard to get a good grade in the class. It just wasn't a very pleasant experience, and I feel like the course needs a major overhaul.",

She is an excellent instructor who definitely took her role of teaching this class very seriously and did a great job teaching it.  She was always very well-prepared for lectures, easy to follow, and enthusiastic.  She's also very approachable and will take the time to answer questions and help students who are having trouble.  In class, rather than just doing math on the board, she makes a point to write out (in words) the steps that she is doing when they are confusing, which makes note-taking a lot more valuable.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I strongly believe that the CS department needs to rethink content of the course.  What I'm about to say applies to any section of this course taught at Columbia.  It covers a wide range of topics, and therefore doesn't have much time to go into depth on any of them.  This alone is not a problem, but what is a problem is that the course is way too easy, almost laughably so, for anyone who has a decent background in math.  This really would be a good course to have an honors version and a regular version (with both countable towards the CS major and minor).  Regardless of who you are, you'll probably learn something in this class.  However, some people will learn a lot more than others, and the course attempts to appeal to students who have had a wide range of mathematical backgrounds.  As someone with a relatively strong background, some of the questions I heard in class were cringe-inducing and painful to hear.  \r\n\r\nA detailed day-by-day syllabus is provided for the course.  I definitely recommend going to the lectures for the material you're trying to learn rather than attempting to learn it out of the book.  The latter is possible, but it's probably harder and more time-consuming than trying to learn from the book because the book is not very good.   Homework from the book was assigned but not collected.\r\n",

                "content": "Dawn is really awesome.  There's really nothing not to like about her.  Some parts of the class were not incredibly exciting, but she was empathetic about this and admitted that some of the material wasn't the most exciting.  She was always well-prepared for lecture and seemed like she really enjoyed teaching the class.  She's also incredibly approachable and friendly, and makes asking questions during lecture very easy.  I am sorry to hear that people took advantage of this last spring in her Discrete Mathematics course, but that was not a problem this past semester.  \r\n\r\nThis class definitely teaches a lot of good material.  The material definitely compliments what is taught in COMS 3137 - \"Data Structures and Algorithms,\" though there is no programming component in this class.  Some of the algorithms exist in a few variants (simplex, one-phase simplex, two-phase simplex, upper-bounded simplex) and it's important to keep these varieties straight in your head.\r\n\r\nThe homework was mostly out of the book.  Some of the problems were a bit of a pain, and a lot of tedious work overwhelmed the concepts that we were learning.  However, most of this is just the nature of the material.  The book itself is not very good, and I don't think it was a good choice for the class.  It has a good number of typos and makes the material so much more complicated than it needs to be.  For that reason, it is important to attend every single class and take good notes, as the alternative of trying to figure out the material from the book is much more stressful and time-consuming.",

He goes out of his way to encourage people to speak during class, even as far as to buy apples before class and give them to people who raise their hand and participate in any way. You can respond to one of his questions correctly, incorrectly, you can ask him to repeat the question, you can ask \"may I please get an apple\", as long as some sound passes between your lips he will give you an apple.\r\n\r\nThis class was much more theoretical than I anticipated. Augustin attempts to summarize papers on sociology, graph theory, social psychology or other topics related to models of large-scale social behavior. Some of the models make sense, for others he makes no attempt to prove that they reflect real-life trends; they simply seem like one person's interpretation of a complicated phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAfter giving a bit of intuition for the motivation for the model of the day, he dives into a heavily mathematical proof for all sorts of bounds relating to the proof which can quickly become overwhelming. He often lingers on finishing up algebra for longer than necessary, but then makes overestimates our knowledge of certain statistical / linear algebraic theorems and rushes through parts of the proof that seem to fly over most people's heads.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks usually involve taking the ideas covered in class and generalizing them and proving those generalizations, which was almost impossible to do on one's own. Nothing is googleable.\r\n\r\nAs other people have said, Augustin is very disorganized. His homeworks are hodgepodges of older homeworks along with new questions hastily written with minimal proofreading. The data challenges took a while to put together, and when they came out we had relatively little time to prepare our setups. The TAs did not fully understand a lot of the material, and we would often have to \"learn together\" during office hours. For a 4995, this class felt more like a 6998 (which I believe it used to be). ",

A good chunk of that midterm dealt with advertising engines' business decisions -- roughly, if they conduct their auction at time X, how does this impact their revenue? -- which has literally nothing to do with networks. In the case of another question, the correct answer was \"sledding in Morningside Heights.\" (Don't ask.) </Preface>\r\n\r\nI think the core of this review can be summed up in a single sentence: \"The lecture slides are in Comic Sans.\" That fact captures the combination of a) trying a bit too hard to be cool (the professor has a pony tail) and b) totally failing to adhere to normal standards of professionalism.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to the review.\r\n\r\nAs others have noted, Chaintreau is an entertaining lecturer but very poorly organized. His assignments are poorly written to the point where virtually every question contains important ambiguities, and important terms and concepts are poorly specified, e.g. we are asked to find property X of a system, but there are multiple conflicting definitions of X and despite repeatedly being asked, the TAs and professor staunchly refuse to pick a particular one. \r\n\r\nThe first programming project (a chat room) had virtually no networking component because you could just use Java or Python's network API; the whole thing amounted to basically just writing lots of switch statements to handle the umpteen-gazillion different chat room commands. \r\n\r\nThe TAs try to be helpful, but their mastery of English is below what's needed to communicate effectively. (NB: This isn't true of just one or two. It's almost all of them. And students from past semesters tell me that's how it was then, too.) Whoever writes the problem sets has the same problem, which is probably a source of some of the ambiguity. That, or sloppiness. Often there are just words missing in the middle of a sentence. They also don't respond usefully to Piazza posts; a non-trivial share of posts get responses like \"well, I think X\", when what we want is not \"what do you think?\" but \"what is the official expectation for students in this class?\"\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, grading is arbitrary -- I'm doing well, so that's not sour grapes talking -- and the solutions are poorly written enough (and dependent enough on particular interpretations of ambiguities in the questions) that it's basically impossible to argue your grade.\r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention that the textbook sucks? It feels like one of those high school chem textbooks, in that it both doubles nicely as a doorstop and is jam-packed with unnecessary verbosity and cute little asides about real-world applications. There are glossy graphs, and maybe an equation every 30 or so pages. Not coincidentally, the book seems like it's written for a high school student, or maybe a smart middle school student. It is decidedly not written with the time constraints and intellect of a college student in mind, particularly not those who have spent enough time immersing themselves in CS to be taking a 4000-level class. Protocols are never proved correct, elementary concepts like a hash function are explained at length, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhat this class needs is a big dose of rigor, not to mention a more disciplined professor. So, please, Columbia, can you get Jae Lee to teach this class, too? Give him a time-turning or something. I'm sure he'll do it.",

Basically, Augustin is very enthusiastic about the material, teaches energetically, and is fairly approachable in person and happy to discuss research topics. The main issue is the lack of organization.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be a pretty busy researcher, as he had to cancel two classes and was often not reachable by email/Piazza. It seemed like he kept pushing back assignments/the exam. At one point he scheduled a make-up class on a day that we are not scheduled for, and we finally had our midterm the last day of class.\r\n\r\nAlso, the grading scheme was not very clear, and the exact percentages were definitely never announced until he sent us a note at the end of the semester. We got very little direction for the final project, which is basically a very condensed 2-page paper that is supposed to have interesting, novel, and relevant results in a research area. This was by far my lowest grade, but in the end he curved the class quite highly.\r\n\r\nI would say the workload was quite heavy, relative to how much we learned in lecture. By the way, there's no textbook - only recommended reading from A LOT of papers (some from sociology). Note that this class is very math/theory heavy, so you really need to be comfortable with probabilistic analysis and graph concepts. I came from this background and still sometimes felt challenged. There are also \"data challenges,\" which basically are exploratory problems with real data. The stressful thing was that our programs were graded relatively to each other, so performance was normalized against the best performing program.\r\n\r\nFinally, the TAs were not that helpful, and we always got back grades very late. I felt like I was in constant anxiety the whole semester and too busy to really appreciate the material. I spent half of my vacation working on the research paper, which in the end, was graded  harshly. Augustin knows his stuff and is overall a nice guy, but the way he managed the class made it very stressful.",

                "content": "The Good: AC has a great classroom presence. He is enthusiastic and will immediately give an apple(the fruit) to someone who gives an answer, asks a question or makes any remark at all. This tends to create more dialogue and fosters a good learning environment. He is very knowledgeable. In the rare case that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer your question in class, he will post a thorough answer on Piazza shortly thereafter. The book is clear and the slides that he uses from the authors can in some cases be used as a substitute for the book. On theory assignments, most of the questions are easy to moderate. There are questions that require \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadvanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 probability, but these are worth a small fraction of the total homework grade. \r\n\r\nThe Bad: The programming assignments were poorly written. The second in particular was poorly designed. Once one was able to translate the second assignment into English, it was incredibly difficult to program. The second assignment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sections had a lot of functional overlap, but this overlap was difficult to capitalize on due to unnecessarily unstandardized features throughout the assignment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear if AC wrote the assignments or if the TAs did. Either way, most of the TAs were not nearly helpful enough in explaining the assignments. \r\n\r\nThe Ugly: For the spring semester that I had him, AT THE END OF MARCH, he changed the grading scheme as follows \r\n10% ->15% for Prog Assignment 1 \r\n10% ->15% for Prog Assignment 2\r\n25% ->15% for Midterm\r\nAC did not announce this change. Aside from a student posting this change on Piazza after it was made on the class webpage, the class might not have realized this until weeks later. \r\nI have never in my time at Columbia had a teacher so secretly and drastically make a grading scheme change so late into the semester.",

I also love that the instructions and test cases are all given ahead of time. It gives me a lot of time as a student to start early and make sure I write my program correctly to earn full points.\r\nThe TA is good, but I wish he would hold more than once regular office hours per week. One hour of office hours each week is not nearly enough for a class of this level that has ~80 students.\r\n\r\nCons\r\nI find Prof. Geambasu's classroom delivery to be disorganized and hard to follow along with. I am not a fan of how she writes the lecture notes word-for-word on the blackboard, and she sometimes trails off while explaining something. There were several instances (e.g. first lecture of Paxos) when I went to the TA after class to clarify a concept, and was told by the TA that the professor made several mistakes when explaining the concept in class. \r\nThe lecture notes are decent, but could be formatted better.",

He has absolutely no proper schedules when it comes to working with project students, and is very demanding and inconsiderate towards other priorities such as coursework.\r\n\r\nHis goals kept shifting during the project and was different from what he discussed at the start. He is very disrespectful and rude. He is quick to blame without proof and sends impolite emails without giving you a chance to get back and reply. The meetings that are scheduled, usually left me waiting. He would change deadlines as per convenience and would expect you to work through vacations, and entire nights. In spite of communicating results, etc through emails and documentations, he ignores those and continues to ask for the same multiple times, which is annoying for the other person.\r\n\r\nHe keeps shooting work giving short notices and when asked for some time due to other coursework conflict, he would intimidate saying grades would be affected. He asked for writeup, other questions about the work I did after the semester ended. These are not clarifications  but those which had been explained during the semester. Though my deliverables were timely and documentation to support it, he still had many questions, often asked with sarcasm and insults.\r\n\r\nHe gets a lot of his work done from students for his PhD. Being a student himself, he treats students working with him with such disrespect. His advisor Owen Rambow was not involved at all in the project, but ended up coming on the research fair as if it is a project with him or at least you would expect he would be involved since he showed up and spoke with you, but that was not the case in reality.\r\n\r\nIt is a horrible idea to do a project with him in my opinion, it is a waste of your tuition money! It is like paying to do work rather than getting paid! I would strongly suggest taking up coursework rather than a project with Apoorv Agarwal.

After seeing how terribly most of us did on the first homework, he slowed the pace of the class way down, which might have been frustrating if you had been really into comp sci, but let's be honest -- anyone who was would have skipped right to Java. For what it was -- a class that I was taking purely to fulfill a requirement -- it was really great. Apoorv is a genuinely nice guy, responds to emails almost immediately, and is always willing to meet with you if you're having trouble. He's young and cool and has lots of friends who work at Google. He also really cares about his students, and obviously wanted us to do well.

Over the course of the semester Choi grew a lot as a teacher (it was his first semester teaching!) and gave us his own examples, clear explanations, and answered questions happily. He also seemed to realize that telling students to leave was NOT a good idea, and encouraged us to send him emails and raise our hands in class.

The material itself is very dense, extremely theoretical, and requires some familiarity with proofs based mathematics. Basically, no amount of coding skills will help you in this class, as it is essentially an advanced math class.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks and midterms are challenging, often requiring insights that are all the more difficult to achieve because Choi's \"explanations\" often you more confused than before the lecture. Be prepared to spend hours staring at a problem trying simply to decipher the meaning of the question. It is absolutely maddening, and yet, there's no better feeling than figuring out one of those tricky questions. The midterms have many true/false with justification questions with no partial credit, which Choi posts on his exams as T/F/J. I wish I had gone for the pure Justify, without ever definitely answering true or false - I would have done better, as the questions seemed to deliberately be exploiting flaws in common intuition and expectations. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this class was a slow, torturous slog through material that had the potential to be interesting, though I don't know if I would go so far as to compare it to the horrors faced by the unfortunate pineapple in the review below. Choi is an uninspired, robotic lecturer who always feels most comfortable reading from the book. There is no reason for anyone to be surprised at this, though, the man basically said as much when he himself advised us to skip lecture on the first day. However, to his credit, he did start to be more responsive to the class's questions and more active in giving us study materials after the entire class performed dismally on a final that he apparently expected to be easy. I think he became more comfortable lecturing as the semester went on, and while I don't think anyone would ever use words like \"interesting\" to describe those last weeks, they were at least tolerable. He gave a generous curve at end, and so, I think Professor Choi deserves at least a B for effort.\r\n     ",

On the first day of class, I came in to the lecture room ready and excited to learn about computer science theory. By the end of that hour and a half, I had already begun to dread my upcoming semester. I even wondered if I should have dropped the class that day, but I didn't and now I really wish that I had dropped it and waited for Professor Aho. To describe my experience in Choi's class would be analogous to describing how a pineapple would feel being slowly twisted into my anus. Choi discouraged us from coming to class under any circumstances on the first day of class. I thought he was joking, so I went to the next two lectures. Considering how awful they were (he paraphrased from the textbook in a very incomprehensible manner), I really should have followed his advice in not going to class. The problem sets were painful. I heard he was mean to his TAs. The midterms were pretty bad, but not as catastrophic as the final exam (which was worth 40% of my grade). I did pretty well in all of my midterms and homeworks, and managed to almost fail the class because of the final exam. I sat through the three hours of the final exam wondering when the pain would end and whether I should just kill myself on the spot because it would be better than finishing the exam.

By the first midterm, I only came half the time, because it wasn't interesting. Before the midterm, he did an informal survey evaluation to see what the class thought. I was in his office hours before the midterm (like most professors, his office hours are useful if you have specific questions). As we were packing up to leave, he said that the evaluations had been really bad, and he had to figure out how to change the class.\r\nAt this point, you might be wondering why on earth you would take this class. Here's the thing: he really listened to the evaluations! I came back to the first class after the midterm, and he had totally changed the way he taught. Instead of going through every proof step-by-step straight out of the book, he focused on the main concepts of the proof. He engaged in a dialogue with the class, asking how we would approach a certain question, and breaking it into manageable chunks. For example, he might start by asking what approach we should take (proof by contradiction, diagonal method, etc). It's amazing what a change there's been in the class.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, if you want a completely formal, rigorous proof of every theorem, you can read the book. (I should mention that the book he uses is very good-- thorough, readable, with useful diagrams.) What Choi's been teaching us is far more valuable-- how to think about a proof, how to go about setting it up. In other words, his class is great for building your logical intuition. \r\n\r\nIt's also a fun class, and he makes it seem much more intimate and interactive than you would expect for a hundred-person class (as you would expect, about sixty people show up on any given day). There are twenty or so people who regularly ask questions, and he's learned all their names. It's a comfortable, yet productive atmosphere.\r\n",

Let me start by saying Prof. Voris is a terrible human being and might be one of the worst people I have ever met. He would often belittle students for asking questions related to class material or about class policies. His assignments were based off what we learned in class with the majority of the difficulty coming from the insane amount of fluff put on top of them. Like he gave us games to encode a solver for and I must have spent 1% of the time on the solving algorithm (the important part of the assignment relevant to the class) and 99% of the time dealing with the absurdly detailed rules of the game that had no reason to exist beside to waste our times. Now back to the real problem Voris. Every time a student asked him for something, like if he could post the blank midterm online after we got it back so we can study it for the final, he would answer in the most demeaning way ever. Every question he felt was a personal attack on himself. Now I am by no means a psych major, but I would say he had a huge fear of being seen as inferior. He would oftentimes go on rants about how in his college, which is some local school that most people have never heard of, he had it so much harder and how Columbia students were entitled and a bunch of cheaters. This rant about how much harder he had it occurred so many times and he would constantly belittle Columbia students as a whole. He clearly was trying to somehow prove his superiority to a bunch of kids who never saw him as inferior in anyway. All I can say is that he has some deep issues and probably would be better suited to teaching at a community college where he does not find the need to always defend himself even if the students are not attacking him. My favorite example of him being an ass if when he was trying to hand out the midterms and basically put them all in one giant pile in the front and told the students to come get it. Of course everyone got up and was gathered around the table. Now what does Voris say? He starts repeatedly yelling (for like 10 minutes straight) \"You all are animals and you should be ashamed of yourselves! I never saw this when I was in school\". He clearly has no idea what he is doing and I hear Columbia is looking to hire a real AI teacher (Voris can't teach very well either so this is a good thing) so hopefully he will never teach a class again. But Voris if you are reading this please go see a Psychologist you have some issues that need to be worked out. ",

However, at the end of the semester, you would find what you had learned was just a bunch of search algorithms plus some machinery that helps you play with logic expressions. I think if Professor Voris had spent less time(or none at all) on giving pop quizzes, explaining the solutions to the pop quizzes and reiterating some of the petty uninteresting concepts, he would probably have had time to cover some more interesting and important topics such as  reinforcement learning and applications of AI in robotics/vision/nlp, etc. But I gotta say this is the first time Professor Voris have taught the course and he did try to teach the course as best he could.

As a result more than half of the class stopped attending lectures (Voris began giving pop quizzes in class around 3/4's of the way through the semester).\r\n\r\nThe Ugly:\r\nProgramming Assignments: The programming assignments were long. I mean incredibly long. The assignments consisted of single page pdf files describing a task in vague detail. There were no suggestions for completion strategies (fine, you don't get these in real life) but more frustratingly, there was absolutely no framework given. The projects often required large amounts of infrastructure (e.g. coding of 5 search algorithms) before any part of the conceptually interesting portion of the assignment could be tackled (algorithm design, heuristic/evaluation functions). Voris was a hard-ass about deadlines, which is reasonable, although perhaps less reasonable was his choice to assign the 4th project and the in class final due 4 days apart. \r\n\r\nExams: The material on the exams was not very difficult, however the exams themselves were incredibly confusing. The midterm was almost as if he had never before written an exam, for practically every question it was difficult to tell even what the question was asking. On top of this, the TA's couldn't answer questions because only 1 of them could speak reasonable english, and the Professor refused to answer questions because he might give away the answer. The final was in class on the last day, and the questions were more clear, however the exam itself was pretty long and somewhat tedious in nature.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous: The professor, in my opinion, had a patronizing tone throughout the class and routinely treated students as if they were stupid. On top of that he did very little listening and a whole lot of talking when students expressed their concerns. No review or example materials were provided for any assignments or tests. And, more of an annoyance compared to the rest of what was going on, the Professor would often engage in pointless discussions (read: arguments) with students about a very specific point of no importance that would last for 10-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nJonathan Voris is clearly knowledgeable and passionate about Computer Science, but in no way qualified to teach this course.\r\n\r\nOne Caveat: I don't know how much he changed the material from Professor Stalfo's version of the course. It is possible that the assignments and lecture notes were entirely the same. This does not change the fact that Voris was an insufferable asshole, who seemingly refused to listen to his students and insisted on wasting class time on pointless and pedantic arguments with students.\r\n\r\ntl dr: Course was horrible, Professor was horrible. If you value your time and sanity I recommend you steer clear (although I don't know if it is being offered again, so it's probably a moo point.) I give this course a 1/10.",

Most of my assignments assignments passed all of the test cases, but I ended up doing poorly on them because the test cases used for grading were not even remotely as easy as the examples he provided.\r\n\r\nThe reviews from Stolfo's class mostly say that he skims over everything interesting in AI.  Voris wasn't much different, and we actually covered less material than Stolfo usually does.  We didn't even get to machine learning, and our last assignment was on logic, entailment via forward and backward chaining (which I thought was an extremely boring project that again, takes more time to write the implementation than the search algorithms).\r\n\r\nThe midterm was fair, but the final was rough.  Voris said that chapters 1-9 would be on the final, yet he ended up testing us on topics mostly before the midterm.  We did not receive any sample questions or past exams, and were unsure of what to expect on the exams.  I though the final was way to long, and Voris said he had planned to make it even longer.\r\n\r\nWe used Piazza as our forum for discussion and questions outside of class.  To be fair, some students did ask questions that could have been easily answered from a quick google search.  But that doesn't mean the instructor should respond to them in a sarcastic and demeaning way.  Some of Voris' answers to Piazza questions were very defensive and sarcastic, including \"Uhh, you can run Eclipse on the clic lab machines?\" or \"I only posted the text file with puzzles because people complained I didn't post any examples\" and \"Guys, I've already made it rather clear that all of the material in the book chapters that we've covered is fair game.\"  He also would write something like \"please see me in office hours if this is unclear\" rather than post a response.\r\n\r\nBasically all the course material (lecture slides, etc.) was given to him by Stolfo.  There were mistakes in the slides, and he usually correctly them quickly.  Although I did hear him arguing with a student about ambiguity in a final exam question and Voris' response was something like \"[Stolfo] has been using these slides for 20 years and I don't think he had this much trouble with grade arguments.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, I guess Voris was a better choice than Stolfo, but if you aren't required to take this class, I suggest avoiding it like the plague.  At least Voris made the tournament extra credit, and all who participated earned at least 5 extra credit points, even if they lost in the first round.",

                "content": "I took this class with Prof. Jonathan Voris.  I'm pretty sure he was roped into teaching the class right before the semester started, if that's worth anything when considering this review.\r\n\r\nQuick Summary:\r\nGood lectures (if a bit dry; depends on your taste)\r\nRanges from very approachable to completely unapproachable\r\nDoes not deal well with grades.  \r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Voris was a good, solid teacher.  He taught the material well, and was mostly light-hearted about the material.  He really seemed to enjoy the class when he took it (7 years ago I think), and he definitely transferred that joy over to teaching it this time around.  I liked his lectures, though sometimes they were a bit dry (often the material was at fault).  Basically, Voris is a good teacher.\r\n\r\nHowever, Prof. Voris comes with a special type of schtick.  The best approximation of an explanation of it is a mix of ego and paranoia.  When it comes to grades, he seems paranoid that every student is willing to kill him if that will give them a better grade.  This is not (much) of an exaggeration; he really is paranoid about this.  When it comes to anything involving grades, simple questions offend him like the deepest of insults, and he is completely unreasonable.  When handing out the midterm, after failing to get students to come up in an alphabetical order, he just dropped all the tests on the table, and sat back, calling the students \"animals\" and \"disgusting\" while everyone searched through the mess to get their tests.  Not cool.\r\n\r\nAlso, if he can't understand a question, he often assumes that the question is stupid, and sometimes even worthy of mockery.  He will always try to explain a question once, but if the explanation is not sufficient for the student, and he thinks that it was, he will make comments like \"I don't understand what's not to get.\" or \"This is pretty simple.\"  He is in desperate need of learning the phrase \"Why don't you come see me after class?  I'll explain it then- we should move on\".\r\nThis ambiguity often translates to the workload- the projects were good, but the formatting was often unclear.  Tiny details that made actually finishing the damn things a nightmare.  To be fair, many students just seemed to ignore what was actually written in the project assignments in regards to submission details (\"Must run on a CLIC machine\" seemed to be an oft ignored instruction for many students).  All in all though, the details just needed to be crystal clear, and they weren't.\r\n\r\nHis midterm and finals were VERY reasonable.  However, the grading of them weren't.  He hasn't posted our final grades, so it is unknown whether he will curve or not, but some of the ways he took off points were pointless.  The purpose of a test is to test our knowledge of the material, not our ability to decipher certain cryptic instructions.  The questions were good- they were actually really good tests.  But, like I said, the grading was off.\r\n\r\nAll in all, he was good for learning the material, and terrible for anything to do with grades.  Just a bit of a nightmare to deal with the schtick.  Not a bad person, just not adjusted to teaching (yet).  If he shapes up on the grading thing though, he could definitely be a really great prof. in the future!",

Between meeting once a week and spending half of the class time on a dubious \"design\" project, we covered only a few topics, and only at a cursory level. The selection of topics was ok: identity based encryption, bilinear groups, byzantine agreement, differential privacy, fully homomorphic encryption, and obfuscation. However, there was no unifying theme; some of these topics are barely even cryptography. I felt like I learned a few neat cryptographic schemes, but did not come away from the class with anything else. There were no assignments aside from working on the design project. We were given papers to read; however, they were simply too long and hard to read in their entirety. I would have much preferred problems to do or more material to read on the basics. Because there were no assignments or exams, no one tried particularly hard to understand the material.\r\n\r\nThe project mentioned above was to design an interactive protocol for key-exchange. The project was well-motivated: we read an attack paper that described a real-life attack against an existing scheme, and started brainstorming how to circumvent the problem. However, after that, we got kind of bogged down. A handful of student presented ideas, but after that, progress more or less halted. Yet we still spent half of the class re-hashing the problem.\r\n",

To my knowledge, this setup doesn\u2019t apply anymore and the second exam had gotten pushed to later on in the semester and became a final. The assignments were staggered such that the conceptual assignment was always due before the accompanying coding assignment. The lowest coding and conceptual grades also got dropped at the time. The conceptual assignments involve calculations, short-answer, etc. related to the topics we went through for the course, while the coding assignments involved applying these concepts for Python code. The assignments we did were:\n* comparing search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc.) for number sliding puzzles\n* backtracking with optimization for solving sudoku puzzles \n* minimax for deciding a move for 2048\n* using a neural network for sign language sign classification\n* a 5th assignment that I unfortunately don\u2019t have the file for at the moment as I skipped it (my apologies)\n\nThese assignments get reused between semesters, and I would say the 2048 algorithm was the most difficult, as it involved testing out different values as part of functions that you need to implement. The sudoku and number-sliding puzzles were the second-hardest, then the neural network one was the easiest out of the four I completed for the class. The exams, however, were pretty rough. I was able to do decently on the first with moderate studying for it, but I admittedly did much worse on the second since I couldn\u2019t finish. However, the course gets curved accordingly, and these exams take up relatively low weight compared to other classes. To that end, the work is a lot more doable to be able to get an A compared to Prof. Dear, as well as other CS classes in the department \u2013 do what you will with that information\u2026"

Ansaf did a terrific job adapting the course to an online format.  \nI am talented at math (A+ in the course) but still got a lot out of the course.  I think prior reviewers do future students a disservice by saying the class is too easy.  \nSo here are the exam stats for my semester: midterm average was 88.6 and the final exam average was 78.4.  Clearly many students struggled with the material on the final exam.  It was a very fair exam -- my point is that the class is not trivial if you really want to master it.     \nSome students have said that it is easy to hurt your score by making a careless mistake. The class is not akin to a heavy computational Ordinary Differential Equations course where a single mistake is easy to make and will throw you off. If you are making mistakes on the problems in this class, you generally do not have a perfect understanding of the concepts. And these are key concepts in mathematics.      \nIf you actually pay attention in lecture, read the notes, and also read the text (the Scheinerman text is solid), you will learn a few important concepts even if you have a solid math background.  And these are very key concepts in math.  The coding assignments are good Python practice. \nEven if you place out of the course, I would recommend taking it.  It's a very crucial course in one's intellectual development and it's enjoyable.",

I will agree with one thing from other reviews: Prof Ansaf is a really nice person.\nGrading literally took ages, with no communication from the TAs or the Prof on why it took nearly a month to get our assignments graded. This made it difficult to see what I needed to work on, and also strategize if I should skip the last assignment or not (since the lowest assignment is dropped).\nThe Head TA for this semester was, to put it nicely, rude. That is the nicest word that comes to mind based on their class-wide announcements and personal interactions. I'm sure they're smart and are very knowledgeable on the subject matter at hand - but their communication skills when interacting with students are poor.\nThat said.. there are some things I really enjoyed:\n\nGenerous final grade, +2 pts if you submit something on time, implementation of Python coursework is a great addition to the course, allowing 'coding group' to work on a coding assignment together was a great way to meet new people in a virtual environment.\nCaveat: I took this class in Fall '20 in the middle of the pandemic.

Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\nI will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, it\u2019s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snail\u2019s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full week\u2019s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I don\u2019t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\nOn the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know you\u2019ll need Discrete in the future.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not sure if I can recommend Ansaf\u2019s version of Discrete. It\u2019s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesn\u2019t require a ton of work, but don\u2019t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes. If you have the option of testing out, I think doing so and taking a more advanced course in its place would be a better use of your time unless you desperately need the GPA boost.",

Really, despite all the comments written below I still think that it is unfair to moke professor only because she is a naturally kind person. She was always approachable and her course was extremely well organized.\r\n\r\nOrganization:\r\n- first of all, you can see all the topics she is going to cover on courseworks from the very first day of the class\r\n- you can also see the dates of upcoming exams/midterms to organize your schedule (you may think that it is always the case but once you get more experience with Columbia, you may realize that it is NOT)\r\n- there were always availability of lecture notes handwritten and typed (also very helpful and rare at Columbia)\r\n- there are two books for this class which cover all the material but students usually do not notice the existence of the second one: it is only for \"inference topic\" but you do not have to buy it. All of them are always available at the library \r\n\r\nOHs:\r\nI personally never went to OH and I cannot say anything about TAs for this class, but the overall organization was so great that I even didn't have to! Everything was in books and lecture notes. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nMidterms were great: you can have a cheat sheet with formulas you may forget. Then you do not need to study formulas: you basically have to UNDERSTAND the material. Moreover, it consists of numerous small problems: it never happens that the problem is worth 40-50-60% of the exam (as it happens in other classes: but you realize it again only with more experience at Columbia).\r\nThat is why when you cannot solve something - you still will be fine.\r\n\r\nOverall feeling:\r\nIt was the only course where you didn't need to stress out and be scared as hell before exams if you missed a lecture because everything was organized so well that another student even didn't need to go to a lecture. Probably, that is why everybody decided not to attend lectures and then to complain.\r\n\r\nTeaching style:\r\nThis class is big: one section is around 150 students. And it is always hard to explain material if there are so many people. \r\nIf you go to the lecture and keep attention to what the professor explains - you will definitely enjoy her teaching style.\r\nIf you stay in the last row and spent half of the lecture on facebook - you probably will not enjoy her teaching style.\r\nThat is why to enjoy this class I would suggest to go to the lecture and try to listen to the professor, to attend her OHs: \r\nit is the only way you will really enjoy the Discrete. Believe me, Ansaf is great: you just have to keep attention to what she is saying. \r\nIn any case, if compared to other classes, you always will be well equipped with all the materials needed.  ",

He has prepared slides that he talked over and annotates, which means it can be hard to keep up when taking handwritten notes since I have to write down everything (plus any annotations) in the same time it takes him to talk about them (and try and listen to what he says). This was more manageable in the start of the semester, but after the material got increasingly more difficult, I couldn't keep up. I was having a hard time understanding all the lectures, and I thought maybe the issue was just that I didn't have a tablet for note taking, but it turned out almost everyone I knew in the class was similarly struggling. I've ended up having to rewatch every lecture after class so that I can follow. He's just not a great lecturer, and I'm not sure how much is really sticking.",

It is hard to feel prepared for them at all. They are also pretty much the only component of your grade.\n\nHe curves the class supposedly, but the curve doesn't seem to be very generous either. Lots of people dropped the class right before the drop deadline (after the first two exams), and that presumably would bring the median grade of the class up (since we can assume most ppl who dropped did so because his grading was so harsh they were worried about failing the class or doing very poorly). I asked him if someone who had received grades around the median for the past two exam might still expect to received a B/B+ (what he had said the median of the class usually was curved to) or if they might end up with a lower grade (since being around the median before people dropping would likely mean falling below the median after people dropping), and he just said he can't see the grades of people who drop when grading. I took this to mean the dropped people aren't accounted for int he curve, and therefore, even being around the median most most of the class could lead to a low final grade. It seems that there is no winning in the class unless you are one of the best. If you start in the bottom of the class, you're worried about failing or receiving a D and drop. If you start in the middle of the class, you may end up falling well below the median in the curve for the final grade.\n\nAlso, it just feels like he's petty about grading. 90% of our grade comes from exam grades, but 10% comes from multiple choice quizzes on Gradescope. Up until the 7th quiz, most people were getting everything right on them and receiving 100%s. After that, he started putting \"trick\" questions on them that seem designed to trip everybody up (and these questions seem to have gotten at least 75% of the class since the upper quartile of the scores on canvas didn't full marks either). I don't get why he'd what to sabotage the one part of the grading that was buoying everyone's grade just the smallest bit."

He is incredibly knowledgeable, doesn't write poorly, etc. But if you want to take ML, I'd recommend not taking it with him in particular. First, because grades are basically not curved (if you care about your grades). But most importantly, beyond everything else, every component of Prof. Hsu's course beyond the homeworks and exams are just total borefests. He has a soft-to-mellow-ish voice in classes, and never really came across as interested in presenting the material properly to the students. On Ed Discussion, no matter how well thought-out your question is, he'll likely just respond with one word, and if you're lucky, a whole sentence.

I also really enjoyed the homeworks; I felt they were highly challenging but doable in the end -- especially with groupwork!! Maybe the downside is that the class is not curved, so I felt high pressure to achieve perfect grades on everything.

Each week, we read a few papers in the field and went through the details in class. At the start of the class, we did some classic results in using expert advice and bandit problems; this material is definitely worthwhile if you have not seen it before. But the rest of the papers were a lot more recent. However, I was not particularly inspired by the papers; they seemed to spend a lot of time defining new learning models which were often infeasible in practice and not overwhelmingly interesting in their own right. Aside from definitions, few of the actual algorithms had novel proofs.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the classes had student lecturers which were of a rather inconsistent quality. I think I would have learned more if Professor Hsu had taught them all.\r\n\r\nHsu also has a bit of a stick up his rear. He spilled a lot of ink making very detailed class requirements, but in the end he gave almost everyone near-perfect grades. He constantly complained about barely late students and has needlessly specific instructions for everything, which made the assignments more work than they were worth. Often, he does not seem to understand student questions or answers them kind of dismissively.

This is both good and bad. It is bad because he will sometimes explain things as though we are all on his level, when really no one else is. Additionally, the homework problems can be very challenging and overly mathematical. However, Daniel is more than happy to answer any questions during lectures, so make sure to ask if something gets glossed over. Additionally, you will really understand machine learning after taking this course. I recommend that you print out the slides and take notes on them, as for me they were useless without commentary (because I am not on Daniel's level). \r\n\r\nTAs:\r\nOur TAs tried really hard, but a few of them fell very short. They often could not help with homework and were unable to answer questions about exams. However, homeworks were graded fairly leniently to make up for this. I was fine with the compromise as I still learned a lot, though it was very frustrating at times when trying to complete difficult homework problems. The best thing was there were a lot of TAs and there were at least one set of office hours each day.\r\n\r\nHomeworks:\r\nMost homeworks involved a MATLAB component that was never too difficult, and was always my favorite part of the assignments. It was cool to actually apply everything and have a classifier that had a low error. Some people thought that these parts relied too heavily on understanding the tricks of MATLAB, but I always just had long runtimes and didn't bother too much with optimization. I never got points taken off for this. The written parts of the homework could be too mathy for me. Additionally, everything had to be typeset so you couldn't just write it out and then take a picture of it, which always added at least an hour to the write-up. \r\n\r\nExams:\r\nThe first exam was extremely long. I don't think anyone finished early. It was tough but I think it worked out pretty fair with the curve. The second exam wasn't so long but I thought it was extremely hard. There were some questions that were straight linear algebra without even having an ML twist on them, which I thought was ridiculous as I had taken CLA 2 and a half years before. However, the curve on that ended up okay too and I think the curve overall was also very fair. I did put in at least 90% effort into this class, but I still ended up with a higher grade than I expected.\r\n\r\nReadings:\r\nThere is a statistics textbook that I couldn't even read it was so over my head. However, the actual ML textbook can be very helpful and is great to read after lectures to clarify things. There weren't as many readings in the second half of the class and I pretty much stopped doing them after the first exam.",

Daniel Hsu is a super smart professor but about as engaging as a piece of wood. He knows the material in and out and leave you with an appreciation for ML by the end. The class runs pretty smoothly from an operational perspective. The response time on Piazza is insane - Daniel gets back to you in a few hours, especially right before HW deadlines and exams. His answers aren't generally helpful. You see a lot of monosyllabic \"No\"s as answers and he will put you down if your question is stupid or poorly worded (thank god for anonymity). However, when he does deem your question worthy, you get a thorough response.\r\n\r\nThe course assumes you have a decent background in calculus, statistics and linear algebra. Daniel does not pull any punches on the math. If you've taken Calc III, Linear Algebra and Intro to Probability and Stats, you should be fine. You have to be familiar with some matrix calculus, basic probability and stats (multivariate Gaussians, expectations, Baye's rule), projections, eigenvectors and SVD from linear algebra.\r\n\r\nDaniel focuses a lot on a lot of theory in machine learning and less on practice. Lots of long proofs and details on the math behind classification models. I personally think this is excellent since ML is inherently a very mathematical subject and understanding it at this level is key. We covered MLE, generative models, decision tress, linear classifiers, perceptrons, SVM, kernels, some ML theory, boosting, regression, PCA, clustering, entropy, HMMs and some math behind a lot of these topics in detail in their own dedicated lectures. Lots of good stuff!\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to stay awake in class since he turned off the lights in 501 NoCo and is a pretty boring lecturer. He doesn't engage with students unless someone asks a question. Thankfully, his slides are great and available online. I encourage you to try to pay attention in class because sometimes the slides are hard to understand on your own right before the exam at the last minute.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks were reasonable and consisted of a mix of theory and programming questions. They were challenging but nothing you couldn't do by spending some time pouring over the slides and going to office hours. Some of the theory questions were hard and it took my hours reading lecture notes or going to office hours to figure them out. The programming part tends to be simple but you have to vectorize your code for it to take minutes not hours, which can be a bit tricky. Assuming you don't pay attention in lecture (because it's really hard to) and that you have to read the slides from scratch to solve the HW, it takes 8+ hours of work on average. TAs were not helpful since they often couldn't solve the homework themselves.\r\n\r\nHis exams are impossible. Numerical grading on tests and homeworks was very generous and countered the difficulty of the exams. However, his letter grade assignments are on the harsh side.\r\n\r\nI heard StatML with Cunningham is fantastic. He's a great lecturer and focuses on intuition. If you want a more practical course, I would suggest that. If you're a CS major in the Foundations or AI tracks and need ML to count towards your track requirements, you're out of luck. Daniel's class is not bad and I would take it again even though it was a little painful.",

It's great but pretty difficult.\r\n\r\nThe overall curriculum of the course is heavily mathematical. There is relatively little concern with \"real-world\" issues like cleaning data or choosing good features. There were some students who sounded like they wanted a course that would teach them how to apply canned algorithms from sklearn or something. It's more about how to implement those algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe first half covered classification problems of various kinds, followed by some learning theory. There's some statistics which comes from a really interesting and unique perspective. It's the first time I've felt statistics wasn't boring. The second half covered unsupervised learning (clustering, etc.) and Markov models. Sprinkled throughout are theoretical discussions of optimization techniques used to fit various models. Finally, the last few lectures were just topics that the professor thought would be enriching, most notably a lecture on how rating prediction systems like Netflix actually work.\r\n\r\nThe class structure is pretty normal -- readings (that you can get by without doing), lectures, and problem sets, plus two exams.\r\n\r\nThe course had a Piazza board, which the professor was always watching. He would give clear, excellent answers, even at weird hours in the middle of the night. He also remained available the night before a problem set. I thought it was nice that he didn't pretend we had good time management skills, although I agree floating late days would have been good, or at least penalties for late assignments rather than refusing to accept them outright.\r\n\r\nThe lecture slides are all posted online and are detailed and excellent. I didn't need to take any notes. But this doesn't mean it's not worth going to lectures! Prof. Hsu is a good lecturer, although sort of quiet. His explanations perfectly complemented the slides. When students asked questions, he listened carefully and gave very clear and cogent answers.\r\n\r\nWe covered a ton of ground, at a decent level of mathematical sophistication. I think perhaps the professor overestimated our mathematical competence. However, those high expectations along with his good teaching skills made this a great class. Hopefully Columbia keeps him around. ",

They were usually a mixture of \"easy\" problems to test basic understanding, programming problems, and one or two proofs. There were never any problems that were unsolvable without knowing some kind of trick or having a deep insight -- hard work was always enough to get them.\r\n\r\nThe programming problems were in MATLAB, and usually consisted of training a classifier on a dataset that had already been \"cleaned\" into a nice format. Getting the code to work correctly was usually easy, but the datasets were large enough that efficiency was actually a serious issue, requiring lots of MATLAB tricks.\r\n\r\nExams were another story. There were two non-cumulative exams, both in-class. There was not enough time for the first exam, and the questions for both were quite difficult and often required a lot of creativity under time pressure. It was not enough to just recall the lecture material -- you had to really understand everything on a gut level. The median was very low for both exams. "

His lectures are thorough and rigorous -- he does not succumb to the temptation to use teaching a survey course as an excuse to skim easy topics at a high level -- and the online lecture notes are quite good. \r\n\r\nAlso, it was really nice that the two textbooks the course uses are both available online for free, legally, and that he provided us links to them, unlike so many professors who assign the $300 latest edition of [insert textbook] without giving students' finances a second thought.\r\n\r\nI was absolutely amazed how fast he responds to Piazza questions; he was single-handedly more responsive than a crew of about 8 TAs in another of my classes. The responses, always within a few hours, are sometimes not what the poster is hoping for (monosyllables aren't unusual: quite a few questions get a \"no.\" and no more, particularly if they're stuff like extension requests), but the question is invariably answered in full. And that means stuff like \"what should we review for the final?\" gets answered with a 28-point bulleted list.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n\r\nNo floating late days. There's a reason almost every CS class offers them, and it's both because they avoid all the whining on Piazza from people who put their work off to the last minute and because they provide a way to grant a bit of deadline flexibility without being unfair to anyone. Professor Hsu, if you read this, you really should consider having a few floating late days.\r\n\r\nThe first midterm was to a considerable degree just a speed test (caveat: I didn't feel that way; I mostly missed points for not being able to remember material. But everyone else I spoke to felt it was a speed test) and the curve was, by CS department standards, fairly tough.\r\n\r\nThe lecture hall (the huge one in NoCo) was dimly lit and has poor acoustics, which didn't make staying awake through lecture any easier given that Hsu isn't exactly lecturing at John McWhorter levels of energy most of the time.",

The professors require that we come up with innovative ideas, yet they outright reject any direction that they think may not be interesting.\r\n\r\nRather than having a discussion about an idea, or even giving a new direction to the same, the faculties insist on changing the proposal - even up till the last few weeks!\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any incentive on the amount of hard-work given in the class, as your grade only depends on whether the professor likes the final presentation or not.\r\n\r\nMore often than not, it seems that the professors make a call by the mid-terms about every group and barely change their grading, despite the amount of effort put in.\r\n\r\nThis is not only unfair to people who are not grasping the ideas taught outright but also rewards those groups that have been judged positively over other groups in a biased manner.

The exams, though ominously long, at least provided many opportunities to earn points. However, I don't think this model actually imparted much lasting knowledge on me. The homeworks, while optional, were exceedingly difficult and discouraged me from even trying to solve them. This turned my studying frantic with few examples of problems at the appropriate difficulty, and exams for me became an exercise in scoring as many easy points as possible. Now, just a few weeks after the final, I don't feel that I retained much.\n\nSignificantly more egregious is, as an earlier reviewer put it, the \"cult of personality\" following Prof. Verma. This ego often manifested into 15-minute sessions of guessing what he used to do at Amazon or getting into time-wasting battles of wits with his favorite students. I often found myself thinking about how a female professor with this level of toxicity would never be entertained, and how Verma's ego represents everything wrong with today's CS field. I hated that my learning seemed to always suffer for preservation of his egotistical nature, and I particularly resent how often he brought up that he wouldn't read/listen to course reviews\u2014exactly why this course seems to have stagnated in its deficiencies.",

It wouldn't be so bad if this Bayesian bully wasn't also borderline abusive to the students. One time in the section 3 lecture he spent 10 minutes grilling a student for having a \"pseudo intellectual\" answer to some question and then held us after class because we ran out of time.

The exams are ridiculously difficult, literally impossible to finish more than 2/3 of the questions since they're so many. It is possible to try and \"game\" the grading a little since its a lot more lenient than the homeworks. Homework median normally in the 70s (which is honestly quite high for how difficult they are, people spend a lot of time on them), midterm median was low 30s, which he apparently thought was too high since the final exam median was in the low 20s."

His lectures are paced well and doesn't try to cover too much content. If you are a person that has difficulty following along in lectures, the lectures are recorded and the slides are on his course website. Professor Verma is usually good about repeating inaudible questions from the class before answering them too. \r\n\r\nThe content is a mix of theory/application, which he mentions early on. He goes through major proofs for ML theorems, but is pretty reasonable about what is in the scope of the class and as a result the math doesn't get too crazy or super irrelevant. \r\n\r\nThe class had no required textbook which is financial plus - and the reading cited on his website were clear supplements that don't go over your head. \r\n\r\nI really recommend making sure you have an okay foundation in linear algebra, maybe prob stats as well. You don't need to be fresh off getting an A in lin alg, but the workload is heavy enough that if you are already taking a full course/research load, it may be difficult to find time to both catch up on the prereq knowledge and also submit thoroughly completed problem sets. He made a couple of jokes about putting test questions that dealt with certain distributions on them, but really all we needed for the class was an understanding of the Gaussian and binomial/Bernoulli distribution.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt like the class was a great introduction to machine learning, and sets up a foundation for future study well.

The questions themselves were not impossible, and any exceedingly difficult portions were quickly revised by the instructor/TA team to be \"bonus\" questions. He was reasonable giving out extensions. If you have team members and start early, they are doable. I would recommend starting early, especially as the code for one problem set took hours to converge - it's not something you'd want to start last minute. \r\n\r\nThe last problem set (for the Spring 2019) semester, was individual and worth only 5%, but was assigned during finals week. The task was to make predictions based from real world data. \r\n\r\nAll of the problem sets served to further understanding of the material, however because they were so long, you may not have time to adequately study the answers/practice with them for the exams. \r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were each worth 30%.

Even though this is a challenging course, I feel safe and comfortable when I sit in the class even though with a weak math background because of Verma's teaching. Verma is very patient on teaching his topics and he cares about how his students learn with quality rather than quantity. He is a strict yet kind instructor. I could feel that he ardently cares about his class and his student. His teaching is perfect. I can understand everything that has been taught in his class even with my weak math background. The pace of the class is slow and nobody would feel lost.  \r\n\r\nThe homework are challenging but are interesting to solve. If you spend time on them you can always find solutions. TAs are also helpful in Piazza and OH. The tests are also challenging. However, grades are generously scaled and you might get A- if you get 60% in tests. \r\n\r\nI learned so many things from this course and it helped me build a fundamental understanding of machine learning problems. If you really want to work in ML-related careers or research, this is the recommended intro-level course. If you hesitate whether this course is too hard, I would say be brave and enroll. You will be fine (suppose you can get 70% right for the homework 0, which is the precondition of enrolling in this class . 70% is not a hard target). \r\n\r\nColumbia University's tuition fees are expensive.

And no homework was due during spring break, which is nice.\r\n\r\nExams: Professor Verma made clear that usually you can pick some questions to finish; this is true. Due to the time constraint of 75~80 minutes, and there are 6 problems in total, I usually can only finish 4~5 problems and not all of what I wrote would be correct.

He assumes knowledge of some advanced multivariate calculus, multivariate probability and linear algebra without going through the techniques explicitly or in any systematic way, while the prerequisite classes cover nothing close to what he requires. This could be partly due to the fact that half the class are grad students, with the overall result that undergrads feel very left behind. At the same time, Prof Verma introduces results of some advanced derivations, skipping over the math in class entirely with the reason that \"it is too easy/simple/boring\", but expects you to reproduce it in a test. He focuses on teaching the \"intuition\" behind the proofs, yet fails to understand that \"intuition\" comes from understanding, which is impossible for most students unless he goes more into the math. \r\n\r\nAnother huge blindspot for the course is that Prof Verma does not give out solutions for his practice exams. This could seem forgivable, except the homework questions are nothing like exam questions (problem sets are more like mini-projects while exam questions are just out of nowhere), so students who have seen questions of this type for the first time are forced to study without any guide or solution. This coupled with reasons mentioned in the above paragraph result in overall confusion before the exams. (In addition, no one does well on the actual exams). The lack of solutions handed out caused some Piazza savagery in my section, which I feel was actually quite justified. I hope Prof Verma sees this and realizes that no learning happens if the correct answer is not given. Perhaps he believes in unsupervised learning, but the results of this can be unboundedly far from the global optimal. \r\n\r\nAs an example of how ridiculous the technical expectations for this class is, during class Prof Verma regularly mentions Convex Optimization, some material from which is relevant in class. I looked up Convex Optimization and it is E6616 - a 6000-level course. If you're not prepared to deal with some 6000-course material that will not be explicitly taught to you, you may not want to take this Machine Learning course. I personally feel it is a shame because the material is super interesting and relevant, and could have been much better taught. A suggestion is a more depth, and less breadth, could improve the class significantly.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class seems to reward prior knowledge, rather than diligence over the course, which is something I have an issue with.\r\n",

But, be warned that the homework was difficult and time consuming, though this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that he allows students to form groups of 3 to work on homework together.\r\n\r\nTests were a mix of very easy questions and a couple rather hard questions. Some of the more in-depth math was fortunately not tested on exams, but there were some difficult theoretical problems. Overall, particularly with the curve, the tests were definitely manageable.\r\n\r\nPersonality wise, Prof. Verma is great. He cracks jokes during lecture and he really cares about his students. His OH often seemed to extend passed the slotted time so that he could continue to help students. His niceness was a bit of a drawback at times in that some students would occasionally eat up a lot of lecture asking basic or unnecessarily involved questions and he wouldn't cut them off, but he got better at handling this as the semester progressed.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a good course that'll teach you ML basics, but it will probably be one of the heavier workload courses you'll take in a semester.",

Look, Omri certainly knows the material but he is glued to the textbook. As I understand it he graduated from Princeton and thinks this book is the bees knees \u2013 the author is a professor there. The book is intense and I for one utilized other books and resources to build some bit of intuition for the material.\r\n\r\nHis lectures are interesting until you realize he is going straight from the book and fails to explain and expand on crucial concepts in different meaningful ways. He does not break down the proofs enough for the class to have any \"ah-ha\" moments. He assumes competency in the proofs and consistently says, \"Come on guys, you should know this\" as a constant response to any sort of confusion the class may have.\r\n\r\nThis is a graduate course and as such most students are Master/Phd students. If you are an undergraduate student, I would not take this course unless you are solid with rigorous proofs and have a solid mathematical intuition. Also, CS Theory is the pre-req course but it is a joke and very trivial compared to this course. There is a huge leap from messing around with Turing Machines in the first couple chapters of Sipser than jumping to Barak's material trying to fathom the complexity zoo.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were okay. Their grading was intense and they expected a lot from the students. Do not take this course if you think it will be an easy grade. I would take this course with Xi Chen or even Rocco who seem to dive deeper into the specific nuances of each proof. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Only take this course if you need it or are stellar in mathematical proofs, they will not hold your hand. Take with other professors for more in depth explanations of material.\r\n",

The Final project, which is encouraged to be done in groups (you choose your own groups as long as your group members are in your TA session, and you can make an exception with your TA to work on it individually), allows you to create a website teaching users a topic of your choice. \nProfessor Chilton highly encourages students to use ChatGPT in their assignments and projects, which made this class easy. However, I would encourage you to still engage with the learning process to really benefit from this class. Even if ChatGPT doesn't help, there are 32 TAs holding OHs every week. Note that Professor Chilton does not give out any A+s.\nUnlike HWs 1-6 and the projects, some parts in HWs 7-12, which were used to guide students in their final projects, felt like busy work, but I found many parts of them to be very helpful because you can create your prototype and your TA will give you feedback on it. Also, HW instructions often had typos, and I feel like sometimes in the lectures after Spring Break, Professor Chilton repeats the same topics.\nSome HWs focused on website functionality, while others focused on both website functionality and graphic design. \nIf you want to explore web dev (both the coding and graphic design aspects of it), check out this class!",

The class had very lenient grading, whereas once certain action items were completed for each of the assignments, full credit was given. I also found it really intriguing that Lydia encouraged the class to use ChatGPT to aid in the completion of the assignments. It created quite a contrast to other courses, where that would be heavily frowned upon. I would say that it\u2019s allowed for by the structure of the class (project-based, and graded based on the nature of the product), compared to other classes, which would incorporate exams and be based on the content of the code used to create a product (and by extension, forbid ChatGPT). For Lydia herself, she was a fairly engaging lecturer and seemed relatively approachable for the most part \u2013 I can\u2019t quite say since I\u2019ve never attended office hours. I say \u201cfor the most part\u201d for approachability because my group met with her for working on one of the final project phases and she didn\u2019t like our idea and honestly ripped into it quite a bit. It felt frustrating and confusing for our group as a collective since some of her critiques went against what we were supposed to aim for for the project.

The final project involved making a website to teach the user something they likely won\u2019t already know in 10 minutes. It was split into multiple phases \u2013 coming up with ideas as individuals, narrowing down ideas as a group, selecting final ideas as a group, creating wireframes for the idea, coloring the wireframe, then lastly, coding up the website. The premise was to write it in HTML/CSS/JavaScript since that\u2019s what we worked with throughout the semester, but we were also free to use libraries (Vue, React, Next, etc.). We personally used React with Tailwind and TypeScript.

However there is a large gap between the examples walked through during class and the homework problems, and a similarly large gap between homework problems and exam problems. Class examples are the foundations but for homework problems you need to learn how to apply your base knowledge. Also reviewing for exams is less about how many problems you do and more about deeply understanding the concepts and solutions for the problems you do. Discrete problems require a level of creativity, so it's more important to just understand what's going on than to crank out extra practice. Problem sets were pretty time-consuming and for harder units like Mod I had to self-study external material to understand. Definitely utilize your resrouces: go to TA and professor office hours. He's hard but fair. I would say take him if you are generally curious, like a challenge, and don't mind putting in the time outside of class to deeply understand the content. If you want an easy A, take Discrete with Ansaf. Final exam was extremely hard, ~110/150 is a good score for an A typically. ",

If you have a limited math background I would 100% avoid taking this class with him, as he really expects you to have higher level math knowledge even though calc I is the only stated prerequisite. I found him to be very nice but not a very good lecturer or teacher, I had to go to office hours or spend time teaching myself everything in this class from online resources because he taught with very vague examples or just didn't teach things needed for the homework. Along with that he would always say to start the homework early and would give assignments 2 weeks beforehand, but wouldn't teach concepts needed to do a lot of those problems until sometimes the class before it was due. Overall, I just felt like this class was made intentionally difficult when it didn't need to be, and he should have spent more time teaching basic concepts thoroughly as well as actually teaching what we needed for the homework. This class to me exemplifies everything wrong with classes at Columbia. Especially given that this is a 4 credit class, I expected a lot more and definitely better organization. Also, just be warned that his tests are very difficult and will test you on things outside of the content you learn in class.",

The bulk of the work comes in a semester long project where you implement a compiler from the ground up. This is a pretty big undertaking, but if you do it incrementally and work on the parts of the compiler as they are taught in class, it will be very doable. The project is done in a group of 6, so it's pretty important that you have a good group to make this project much more manageable since it is a considerable amount of work."

Doing the homework assignments depended on going through the source code of LLVM, navigating around documentation on your own, and trying to figure out what was going on. This was justified by the professor because she said that obviously theory taught in class will be different from applications on homeworks. But had a student not posted a Google Doc on Piazza of research that she had compiled and shared with the class, honestly I wouldn't even know what LLVM is. Grading was very arbitrary.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the professor cares very much about teaching her students and making sure that we understand. This is apparent because she took time in class to ask for and answer questions. However, I had no questions because I didn't even know what to ask. All her slides are also adopted from other professors and better versions can be found online.\r\n\r\nI would recommend taking PLT with any other professor if possible.",

The rest can be knocked out in an hour or two though.\n\nThe final quiz was also a breeze if you paid attention in class. In fact, Prof. Vondrick dropped hints for most of the final's questions and their answers throughout the semester, so it's in your best interest to go to class or watch the Zoom recordings.\n\nGrading was more than fair. There were two strategies to assign letter grades and Prof. Vondrick automatically picked the strategy that gave you the best grade. The first strategy was a curve. The second strategy was the standard grading scale:\n90% overall guarantees at least A-\n80% overall guarantees at least B-\n70% overall guarantees at least C-\n\nMost people finished with an A.

The earlier lectures on image processing were simply mind-blowing to me and a good foundation on accessing the field of computer vision. Past neural networks, it gets a little hand-wavey (as classes tend to, as I've learnt, after deep learning comes in and dominates the field) because Prof. Vondrick doesn't really get into the details of constructing a neural network tailored to CV, and talking about theory on a powerpoint only gets you so far. However, he continues to give great theoretical intuition on how the math/techniques work. You can tell he is a brilliant man.\r\n\r\nPretty good class and I learnt a good deal.

His homeworks are incredibly easy and also taken from Prof. Bauer, and exams are very easy as well.

And that's how it should be.\r\n\r\nThe homework problems can be a bit annoying especially the do-the-algorithm by hand part but it also definitely helps with understanding how things work. The programming assignments are super fun and some of the best I've had in the department. We're provided with a  clean scaffolding of the code which is unseen in any of the Intelligent Systems track classes. Because of that I feel like we don't get dragged into writing stupid and time-consuming systems around the crux of whatever we're learning. You just get into writing the NLP model/algorithm.\r\n\r\n ",

                "content": "I have a lot to say about this class, some of which is in response to what has already been said. I'll try to keep my argument structured and evidenced and give my final review at the end. For context, I'm an undergraduate junior who's already taken enough 4000 level classes in the department to feel confident vouching for these opinions. \n1. First things first, I agree with the other posts on the disorganization and intense workload of the class. Analysis of Algos is one of the most intense workload classes I've taken at Columbia (not the hardest, but a lot of work). It would've helped to have a reasonable routine for problem sets and for quizzes/readings, and it is really troubling that this was not followed. I agree that as a class, it's insane that we have to deal with this in the middle of an online sem. It's also crazy how a little bit of everything counts, so you cannot really slack off on any parts. The lectures are very fast, and it's not possible to keep up with the class at all points of time, with the readings the core resource in helping to follow. \n2. I do not agree with the assessment of the TAs, and especially name-dropping of the TAs in the post -- it's unfair and gives a very biased view of what happens in class. In my opinion, Max Helman and the team (despite their quirks) have done their best to be helpful. I think the grading is a bit too harsh with too many requirements, and rubrics need to be more precise, but this is common to most Algos sections. Previous posts mention that its ridiculous to have 3 hws, a project and a final in the final weeks of the class and I fully agree, but it's worth noting that the students voted to have a project to take the weight off of the final, and that the TA team orchestrated that the request was heard. I too voted for the project and it was a bad decision in hindsight, but this was not a TA decision to add more work. In my opinion, the TA team has been resourceful and responsive on Piazza despite being uncertain from time to time about logistics which I doubt were in their control. I had many instances asking for readings + homework, and was told that this decision had not been taken on a professor level despite them following up. This brings me to my final point:\n3. Christos Papidimitriou is a legend of the CS world. He teaches this class once in a while because he feels like it, and out of a pure passion for algorithms. The passion is apparent in his fast-paced lecturing style and the breadth of his syllabus. It's very rare to have a professor who's written the textbook of the class, and even rarer to have one of the smartest people in the world as your Prof with the crazy CS network Prof. Christos has: including the likes of the founding members of Google and Microsoft and several dozen Turing Award winners and award-winning textbook authors that are his friends. He has contributed to evolutionary biology as he has to game theory, to complexity theory as he to database theory. I think when people sign up for his class, people are looking for the experience of learning from a 'famous' professor. And I think the disorganization in the class is purely a consequence of the same: he's a very busy person who wants to say a lot about a lot of things. This by no means is trying to say it's ok to not pay attention to the requirements of the students. As I've said before, I disagree with how lectures and organization for the class went. I just think that the status of Prof. Christos's achievements along with the fact that he infrequently teaches the course means that the structure can get a bit haywire, not as a consequence of TA involvement but rather purely as an artifact of everything he wants to cover and how he relays this.\nFinally, I want to note all this is true of a zoom semester. There's close to no interaction in the lectures or breakout rooms and it's so easy to fall behind in class, after which the mandatory attendance requirement means that loads of people attend for the sake of it. naturally, the online learning environment does not lend itself to question answering beyond those that are already confident of the material and this contributes to the issue. I would not generalize from what I've written above or what others have written of the Spring 2021 iteration to beyond the online medium. \nFinal outcome: \n\nAgree with: heavy workload, fast lectures, disorganized content\n\nDisagree with: evaluation of the intentions and commitments of teaching staff. I think they've tried their best to help through the semester and the haywire experience is more a consequence of the general direction of the syllabus + online medium.\n\nSummary: take this class if you want the experience of having prof. Papadimitriou as your professor and want to flex about it for the rest of your Columbia journey and CS education career for when he wins his next big award. Don't take it if you expect light workload + easy psets related to the core algorithms taught in a more traditional algorithms sequence. Don't make a decision on whether to take it from looking at the TAs, but instead do so based on your expectations for the class. I doubt a change of staff will do one bit to alter the direction Prof. Christos takes his syllabus and expectations.",

Only take this class if you are extremely self-disciplined and a genius in CS. A lot of people in this class are graduate school students, so if you are an undergraduate, be prepared to get lost at the beginning of the class. There are almost 100 people in this class, but there really aren't too many people participating due to the poor lecture structure and his teaching. I don't understand the majority of the things he teaches and have to rely on the textbook and self-learning 99% of the time. As an undergrad, I think this probably doesn't apply to a lot of the classmates coz there are a lot of graduate students, who probably have already seen most of the things taught in this class. Even though it's on zoom, he requires attendance, but I can't follow at all. There are always geniuses in this class who understand everything and make the professor think that everyone in the class understands what he's talking about. He enjoys putting us into breakout rooms, but NO ONE, literally NO ONE, talks in the breakout room (I'm not even sure whether people are actually listening to the course). He goes through everything pretty fast because you are supposed to understand everything deeply in the textbook before coming to the class, so you are basically fu.ked up if you don't do the readings. The content of this course is super important, but I really don't recommend Christos at all unless you learn everything on your own.",

I want to preface this with the fact that I am taking his algos class during a Zoom semester, so I'm sure it's hard for everyone, including the TAs and the professor, but the class is incredibly disorganized. We have mandatory quizzes before every lecture on the lecture material (which, although aren't worth a lot of our grades, are still stressful to have to worry about). The readings that these quizzes will be on and the quiz itself are often not posted until 10 PM or later the day before our 10:10 AM class, and we are supposed to take the quizzes before the lecture starts. Weekly psets are also sometimes posted late (posted Friday and due before Wednesday morning). Piazza is the main medium of communication, which is messy and it's difficult to find important messages.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this class at all.",

Topics include special graphs (trees, bipartite, etc), planar graphs, graph coloring, matching, random graphs. Mostly follows Robin Wilson\u2019s textbook on Graph Theory. \n\nPros: \n* Yihao is super kind. She\u2019s also quite response on EdStem / will give clear answers to any questions you have on lecture material / homework questions. \n* She\u2019s the type to be quite clear on what to expect out of exams, and exam materials / homework questions are never things out of the blue. She also usually spares the class by not putting any exam questions that pertain to the most difficult topics in the course. \n\nCons:\n* Her lectures are a bit boring? She moves pretty slow through the slides, but that is arguably a good thing if you are just trying to breeze through a class \n* Lecture slides are sometimes a bit too succinct to be clear what\u2019s actually going on, but also the textbook is readily available online and it can help patch up any holes you may have. \n* Because the class size is so small, it may be a little difficult to get a \u201cgood\u201d Grade, since she curves the median to a 90. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d say take the course if you a) want an easy, straightforward CS course to take and/or b) you are actually interested in graph theory. If not, it\u2019s probably not worth your time. \n",

The foundation you learn in this class will certainly help you apply causal inference to other applicable fields, like ML or data science (but don't expect to LEARN how to apply causal inference to other fields in this class). \n\nTook Causal Inference I fall 2023. One thing to note is that Bareinboim definitely knows his stuff, and is definitely one of the top causal profs in the field - he did his PhD under Judea Pearl, one of the most significant contributors to the causal field in contemporary times. \n\nThe class is solely focused on the probability and models that drive our theories and frameworks of causality. You will not code at all, and the most he goes into applying the ideas to other hot fields, like ML or data science, is in the very last lecture, which you aren't tested on anyways. This is not a diss to the class - I personally loved learning about the math and theoretical backing.\n\nBareinboim lectures primarily using his slides - the slides are honestly quite decent, though sometimes certain slides can be difficult to parse without hearing him go over them in lecture, which he unfortunately doesn't record. He will occasionally scribble diagrams and math on the whiteboard, but they are usually incredibly messy and tangents anyways. Ultimately, he's a solid lecturer, but definitely not that entertaining / engaging, but imo that's few and far between in the CS dept in general. \n\nOh, he also provides free access to this online software he, or his lab, created (I believe), which basically allows you to build causal graphs and automatically calculate important causal relationships from them. This is honestly so amazing, as it can basically calculate a third of the problems (the easiest ones) on the homeworks for you, and more importantly really helps when you are trying to digest some of the concepts and just want to tinker see how some of the messy theoretical concepts he describes in class actually applies to sample causal graphs. \n\nProbably my biggest irk for the class was how difficult it was to get help from OH. There was only one TA and Bareinboim himself that offered OHs each week, and so usually there would be swaths of students scrambling to ask them questions about the HW during the OHs. Oh well. Just try to take the course with a friend, and you can avoid the OH mess by just working together on homeworks. \n\n\n",

The questions are fair, and not out of this world difficult. The hardest will usually just be applying what you learned in lectures to a novel situation. I think the average for both was in the 50-60%, which actually isn't horrible compared to some other Columbia CS courses, but the std dev was tight - the max for both fell around 75%. I really don't think Bareinboim expects you to finish these exams, unless you are literally cracked. \n\nSilver lining is that for both homeworks and exams, they are generally lenient on partial credit. \n\n"

                "content": "I personally like it a lot and will highly recommend it, but I will provide some context.\nContext: I take some courses in physics (quantum mechanics), math (abstract algebra), TCS (complexity theory, algorithms etc.), so I'm quite conformable with proofs, abstract concepts, and quantum weirdness.  Also due to these experiences, I get pretty accustomed to learning by myself via notes from class (or textbooks). So given these, I still feel the class is a relatively hard one.\nProfessor Henry: Absolute nice and approachable. I believe he is the only professor currently specializing in quantum computing (a lot of big names probably also research on these, but I guess it's not a thing in their times and they don't do courses on his.) He is knowledgeable about the field, but perhaps due to his age and also the online format, I guess the lectures can be somewhat unstructured. Also, I believe he has never taught the topic to an undergraduate class, so he might have a slight over-expectation for this class.\nLectures: Amazing and exciting! Quantum computing is so different from classical computing that you will feel like you are studying the frontier of science, and indeed we learn about all basic quantum computing stuff you probably heard from pop-science articles (Shor's prime factoring, Grover search, quantum teleportation...), rigorously. The downside is the materials are quite dense and I can imagine many students will feel a but overwhelmed (plus a bit unstructured mentioned above). I believe the class will get even better when you guys take it given Henry will get more experienced\nPsets: there are only six psets (a pset0 for entry test and 5 normal psets) with no exams (originally the final exam is an additional pset but canceled). They are on average quite long, and one or two of them are quite hard (need to think hard). Many questions correspond to derivations that we don't have time to go over in class, which I like. Many other questions map to research papers in the field (I guess important/foundational ones) as an extension to the class material. Professor tries to guide us through the process in the psets, but they can be still quite hard (even when I find the corresponding papers) and take some time. But overall, I like them and I think they are very informative, useful, and fun. Like the lectures, I believe the psets will get updated and become much more manageable and even more fun.\nOverall: hard class(for CS students who haven't done a lot of theoretical classes), but very fun. Plus, I believe it will get even better in the future.",

Scheduling mandatory group meetings is a challenge, questions on Ed rarely get answered, and the grading process\u2014despite having a rubric\u2014feels subjective and unclear.\nThe TA assigned to my group, in particular, made the experience far worse(one is the head TA). They seemed entitled, focused more on their own preferences than on supporting students. For instance, we were required to submit video explanations for coding assignments (because grading code directly was \"too much trouble\"), and the TAs insisted the video links be included in multiple places\u2014like the README file, Gradescope, and sometimes even an answer PDF. If there were mistakes in the homework instructions, they wouldn\u2019t clarify or answer questions, which only added to the confusion.\nI\u2019ve also heard there are some good TAs in the course, but unfortunately, my experience was very different.

I took this Fall of 2020 and it was one of the few classes during the pandemic that kept me entertained. Prof. Smith's energy is infectious and he consistently gives energetic lectures. The TAs I interacted with were all very helpful and provided meaningful feedback. I thought the workload was easily manageable and grading was very generous (class average was probably around an A-). I still use a lot of the design skills that were taught and definitely felt like I learned a lot from the class.

As the other review mentioned, you learn about ray tracing and pipeline rendering with OpenGL.  Lectures are standard PowerPoints that can be a bit boring as the lecture was from 7-8PM.  I stopped attending lectures midway through the semester.  The first 5 codio assignments are building a ray tracer, starting with a basic one and then adding enhancements like shadows and reflections. The last homework was on pipeline rendering, and to be honest I was carried by a friend for this assignment as my other courses started to ramp up their work. By the end of the semester, I feel like I know the basic steps of how ray tracing works.  My pipeline rendering knowledge is a little shaky though.  I would encourage anyone who is thinking about taking this course to not take it with heavier courses like FUNDIES and CST like I did...if you do, take it with friends who have lighter courses and can help you with the work.  I did not attend a single OH for this course as HWs 1-4 can be solved easily with the textbook's and PowerPoint's pseudocode. Start early on HW5 and HW6!!!",

So, if your output resembles the correct output, you most likely will get an A on the HW assignments.  The only A that I didn't get was HW6 bc I started really late on it.  EdStem is your BEST friend, a lot of the students helped each other out on there, the TAs didn't respond as much on EdStem towards the end of the semester though.  If you're a procrastinator, you could definitely pull a weekend of all nighters doing this HW.  I spend 3 straight days working on building a sphere (I slept though).  No midterm, one Final.

He makes sure he covers everything in great detail for the recorded lectures, even though only a handful of students were showing up to the class (it was taught late in the evening).  \n\nYou will learn how to build an image renderer from scratch using ray tracing in the first 5 homeworks, starting with simple shapes (triangles and spheres), moving on to shadows and reflections, and finally textures and meshes.  The fifth homework assignment is the longest and most difficult, as it involves implementing multiple different concepts:  Texture mapping, triangle meshes, antialiasing, BVH nodes to speed up rendering time. \n\nA lot of the skeleton code has been completed, and usually the professor has given you some pseudocode in the lecture slides to be able to implement the rest, but there are quite a few things that are unstated and you will need to do some research on your own to be able to complete the assignments.  I found that the discussions on EdStem were very helpful in being able to complete the assignments, as students usually ran into the same problems and would share solutions to them, but you can\u2019t really rely on this as the forum was not very active except around the time when assignments were due and you will need to get a head start on most of them to complete them in time.  The final homework is an introduction to OpenGL, loading multiple triangle meshes in one scene, using linear transformations to scale, line up and rotate the meshes, and implementing Phong shaders.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot.  The creative submissions part was optional but my favorite part of the class, as it gave a break from the coding and math and let me exercise a bit of creativity with 3D modeling.",

There are two main things the prof teaches: Ray Tracing and OpenGL. The first set of homeworks makes you gradually build a ray tracer using C++, and the last one focuses on using OpenGL. I slacked off the first half of the class, and had to seriously pull up my socks in the middle of the semester to pass. The thing with the homeworks is that they build on the previous ones, so if you don't understand the previous ones, you're going to be in a lot of trouble for the future ones. So please try to be very dilligent from the very beginning otherwise you're going to have a seriously difficult time (and spend a lot of nights crying wondering if you're going to pass, like me). Going to TA office hours is not optional for this course. You will HAVE to go to them to be able to do the homeworks, because even if you understand overall concepts (which the professor does explain very well), there are a LOT of nitty gritty implementation details that are simply impossible to do unless someone shows you how. You don't even realize there are things you need to do unless they are pointed out. Unfortunately, I only realized this midway through the semester (which is when you're doing the most difficult homework, btw), and went to basically every OH then (IMMENSELY helpful, I cannot stress this enough). Special shoutout to Nathan Wu and Saravanan who were great TAs. Overall though, this class has made me seriously consider the field as a profession. The final was actually pretty easy since it focused on understanding topics as a whole, and not small implementation details. \nThe one thing that really kept me going is how good the professor was. He genuinely loves what he's doing, both the field itself and also teaching students. He is also extremely understanding when it comes to the amount of time students need for the homeworks, extending deadlines when he realized that students needed more time for certain assignments. He also held lecs where he invited speakers, had competitions for extra credit (voting based), and just genuinely seemed like he wanted to help whenever you needed it. I was able to talk to him about my progress in class when I was scared I wouldn't pass, and he gave me a lot of pointers on what I could do to get better and assured me that I'd get through if I was able to work on the bonus assignment and the last one, which was easier than the others. He was a visiting prof so I'm unsure as to when he will teach this course again, however. \nI ended up with a B- at the end, which was surprising because I was pretty sure I was going to flunk it. Class is curved. Overall highly recommend this class, but you need to be able to ask for help. Great professor, but the class is going to make you seriously work for it. ",

He does read feedback, so maybe he'll improve in the coming semesters. In class, he'll just read off slides that go over concepts briefly before bringing up some methods and reading off the man pages, and going through his code. The class is just not organized in a beginner-friendly way; to actually understand what we were doing, I also had to supplement with Jae's notes or consult ChatGPT lol. His class does seem to cover a little more than Jae's class, which seems to focus slightly more on depth.\n\nTLDR: I quite enjoyed his Data Structures class, so I think it's worth it to take Data Structures with Borowski (especially because he's so approachable and easy to talk to), but go for Jae if you're doing AP.",

The first midterm was pretty long and a lot of the class did not finish, so the second midterm (final) was easier. Both had an average of low-to-mid 60s.

Professor Borowski is not a great lecturer.\n\nHe is not excellent at explaining things in class, and he struggles to gain the attention of all the students because he mostly reads from the slides and does not give any explanations that may add to the content in any way.\n\nThe problem is that Dr. B and the TAs may not be very helpful.\n\nOnce in his office hours, Dr. B struggled with helping a student debug their code. Similarly, once a TA gave us a problem that he had originally said would take us 15 minutes to solve, and when he did that same problem during recitation, it took him 1 hour and 20 minutes to do the same. Also the class size is very large, so we had to wait hours for debug a single problem out of nine problems on each assignment.\n\nHowever, Dr. B didn't effectively convey the content. A good number of his assignments are focused on coding the basic implementations of the methods for Data Structures, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and hash maps. In my opinion, this is not a good thing because he did not give us enough practice using the method implementations to code more complex methods. This problem with the assignments is especially bad when you are practicing for coding interviews.",

Then, after the second Midterm, you had one week to complete a Capstone Project during the other final exams. That is a lot!\n \nHe often deducts marks for silly things, such as using additional space in the answers.\n \nDr. B gave 9 late days throughout the semester for 12 assignments in total. You cannot use late days on the Capstone Project and two of the theoretical assignments. Dr. B is not lenient with providing extensions. He provided class-wide extensions on two of the assignments, which led to work management issues as deadlines for them were pushed to be one or two days before the midterms.\n \nAdditionally, I have heard of a student who spent the whole week working on the Capstone project, and as a result, she did not have enough time to study for her final exams. She made a mistake in her submission, which was that she submitted an entire file instead of the specified code snippet, so Dr. B did not accept her work and gave her a 0.

He can be a bit \"funny\" in class and on EdStem, is very easy to talk to in office hours, and works very hard (on more than one occasion he typed out very detailed responses to questions he got in class). However, I didn't come out of the class - both classes - feeling like I *learned* anything at all. I definitely memorized a lot of things - all of which I have completely forgotten now that the course is over - but I never got to see why things work the way they do, and never really came close to achieving a big-picture view of the class. I think the \"weekly quizzes\" section of the class grade was pointless given that its intention was to encourage attendance. I know I'm going to sound arrogant here, but I really think the homework assignments were too easy. At best they helped me improve my pattern-matching skills, because very similar work was already done during class. Add in the fact that we worked on them with a partner, and I didn't spend more than 5 hours on any of the 7 homeworks. The exams are a horrifying joke; to study for them, I recommend you find a way to somehow download the Linux man pages of every single function you ever used in class, homework assignments, or recitations into a memory cache in your brain (this is an exaggeration), but this is a feature of any AP class you take anyways.\n\nAll in all, I definitely don't feel ready to take OS with Nieh at all, despite getting an A in this class.

I thought he was an engaging lecturer, and I liked how he would code sample apps or functionalities in-class. Admittedly, it felt like he passed through writing the code a bit quickly to the point where it was a bit tricky to follow along, but I just deferred to the slides that he presented with to fill in the gaps. The demos also didn\u2019t work the most consistently, but I understand things can happen at times. I also really appreciated the guest lecturers that worked for Apple that he invited for one of the classes. The policies for the class were very lenient (such as how students could borrow MacBooks if they didn\u2019t own one) and I would say somewhat paralleled User Interface Design in the sense that we were encouraged to search code snippets and use ChatGPT to aid in the creation of the assignments. The reasoning behind it appeared to also parallel UI \u2013 project-based, and graded based on the nature of the product as opposed to incorporating exams and being based on the content of the code used to create a product (and by extension, forbidding ChatGPT and other AI tools). He and the TAs were very approachable and lenient with grading the HW regarding deadlines \u2013 I accidentally forgot to push a change I made to GitLab (which we worked on) for one of the assignments, so I shows it to the TAs, and they gave me credit for the changes once I pushed! All in all, I really liked learning Swift through this course and it definitely helped demystify it for me.",

The four homeworks involved implementing smaller apps in Swift using XCode \u2013 basic Storyboard implementations, editable table view with accompanying detail views, usage of an API to display data in a table, and usage of the MapKit to implement a Map that shows data form an API. For the team project, we had to come up with a project idea to make in Swift, program it, then make a video presenting it. It was admittedly intensive for the time we had to work on it and I admittedly would have preferred some of the time for the homeworks instead being allotted to working on the final project (similarly to User Interface Design). Additionally, the time to work on the milestones (along the lines of coming up with ideas/features, creating a MVP, creating the full app, final touch ups) felt a bit lopsided. Then, the last two milestones definitely took longer than the first two, but all four only had an allotted week. Beyond that, I thought it was a very doable class to get an A (or even A+) in!"

They break down all of the requirements with no hidden test cases, so you know exactly what you need to build to receive full credit.  Because I was taking heavier courses with this one, I started most of my HWs the night before they were due and stayed up until 5AM to complete them.  All HWs are due before class time, which was 4:10PM for me.  The second half of the semester consisted of a group project.  My group had a lot of issues, but we were transparent with the Prof and TAs who were very understanding.  You present your group project to the class, the TAs, Professor Hugh and some of his colleagues from Apple and Google!  If you're into networking this was a great experience for that.

The only way you're going to do well in this class is if you are a gifted academic, a senior, a psych major, or a total suck up - with emphasis on the latter.\r\n\r\nAn example: this semester, she randomly broke out in a yelling fit because she felt not enough people were participating during the mental rotation lab. She literally made a girl cry. Keep in mind that this lab class is full of people who don't know psychology well (no less understand the complexities of MENTAL ROTATION) and are just trying to fill the requirement. Most don't have anything insightful to say, and if they did, they wouldn't know when or how to say it because she is so unbelievably unclear.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, she'll try and dock points off of your grade in any way she can. If she doesn't like you (she picks and chooses random people to not like), you're screwed.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is you should stay far away from her if you can. If you can't, suck up to her.",

I took this class merely to fulfill the science requirement. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this class went. \r\n I thought professor Levine was very clear in her lectures, almost too clear sometimes. She always took time to explain concept and answer questions. Unlike another professor who substituted for her a few times. She also clearly made an effort to make the material seem interesting by bringing in a flutist, discussing her own research, and having us participate in fun activities in class. \r\nYes, we were required to know more information than was discussed in class: this seems like a standard practice, the previous psych courses I took had the same format. \r\nThe exams were challenging as they should be in a college setting. What compensated for this though was the generous curve. Grades in the 74 range, the class median, were curved to an A-. \r\nAs for the lab, yes, it was long and drawn out, in my mind as all labs should be. But the experiments involving the mberry pill and the final experiment which we designed ourselves were quite interesting. For all the labs, instructions were clearly laid out. There were no surprises. \r\nI think Levine is a pretty good professor. ",

Her exams are a crapshoot, it's impossible to figure out what will be on them. She gives you a \"fair game sheet\" but then most of it is \"study entire chapter\" which is not very helpful at all. In lab she is rude and likes to take points off for little things. For instance, she will take points off if your page numbers on your lab report are in the wrong font, never mind that the content of the report is great. It is very hard to connect with her, and as the last post mentioned, she is not at all engaging. She comes in to class ready to \"get it over with\" and doesn't really care about the success of her students.

He also has a large team of TAs, so if you\u2019re struggling with a concept, there\u2019s plenty of support available. He\u2019s also very understanding and approachable.\nThe class is well-organized. He uses Jupyter Notebook (which he posts after class) for lectures and runs code on it to demonstrate concepts step by step. During lectures, he\u2019s happy to answer questions, (even after class too).\nThe homework and projects aren\u2019t too difficult, but it\u2019s important to start early to give yourself time to think through them and ask questions if needed. The homework does a good job of preparing you for the types of questions he gives on exams. He dedicates an entire class to review before each exam, which is really helpful.\n\nLectures can sometimes feel a bit dry, and I found myself nearly falling asleep a few times. Also, exams and PSets take too long to grade.\n\nOverall, Professor Bauer is a great instructor who cares about his students and provides plenty of resources to help them succeed.\n",

He also emphasized that reviewing the exercise sets was important for exam prep. Exam grading was fair (ex you could get partial credit on questions if you showed your work or logic).\n\nThe first two exams were fine, but the final one was more challenging.

This year, the grade cutoffs (uncurved) were as follows: A+ 98, A 91, A- 85, B+ 80, B 76, B- 70, C+ 68, C 65, C- 58, D 45. The project is 30% of your grade, the midterm is 20%, and the final is 50% (if you do better on the final, it replaces your midterm grade). The final was pretty reasonable. "

This is a required class for a lot of people, and it's gonna suck for a lot of people, but I DO NOT RECCOMEND TAKING THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR CHEN. He seems nice enough, but his teaching style and class structure is a mess. Try a different professor.\n\nClasses consist of the professor writing notes on a chalkboard and trying to explain concepts. The notes are borderline unreadable if you don't sit in the first few rows. I often found myself having to take a picture of the board with my phone and zoom in just to read it. The recordings frequently had problems such as missing audio, a completely zoomed out camera, or bizarre camera angles that make it impossible to read the board. Oftentimes if you missed the notes in class, tough luck, there's no way to look back at them. The professor has an accent that may take some getting used to, but the main issue is just the confusing and dry way he explains topics. Despite attending every lecture, I learned a lot more from YouTube than class. I recommend the channel \"Easy Theory\".\n\nThe organization of topics is reasonable, but the organization of the class is a hot mess. Along with the problematic recordings, questions on Piazza (our Q&A board) were frequently left unanswered. The professor also doesn't use Courseworks for anything, instead opting to use his own website. While I didn't experience this personally, there are many posts on Piazza of people complaining that TAs ghosted them (just didn't show up during scheduled office hours). If you actually manage to attend an office hour, TAs often give confusing, conflicting information that sometimes even needs to be clarified with Piazza posts or emails hours or days later saying \"actually ignore what I told you in that office hour\". When I went to office hours, I found it far more useful to discuss the homework with fellow students instead of trying to get answers out of the TA. There are occasional review sessions held by TAs, some of which were fairly helpful. However, links to the recordings of these review sessions were often missing, broken, or hidden in the reply of a reply of a Piazza post.",

They usually require you to write some proofs. I frequently struggled with them and needed to attend office hours, research the concepts, and spend hours upon hours on the assignment. There is a textbook that can provide some help. Homework is submitted through Gradescope and is graded pretty slowly (several weeks). They do give partial credit and I generally found grading to be pretty fair. Late submission are not accepted.\n\nThe midterm and final are both only 1 hour and 15 minutes long and consist of 5 questions. This is a good amount of time, and most of the questions seemed fair. HOWEVER, on both the midterm and final, the first question consists of several true/false sub-questions, each of which are worth a RIDICULOUS amount of points. On the midterm, each one was worth 6 points (the whole exam is worth 100 points), and since there obviously isn't partial credit for true/false questions, just messing up on a few of these can absolutely tank your grade.\n\nI think getting a passing grade in this class is reasonably achievable, but this class will also probably suck your soul out and make you hate this topic."

Maybe it helped that his general attitude was very understanding, e.g. \"I know this doesn't make a lot of sense but it hopefully will in 5 minutes,\" said in a way that was in fact understanding and not condescending/outright false. He is understanding just as a person also (accepted HW submitted past late deadline, but don't push your luck).\nThe material is not the easiest of course, but, as with many logic/theory things, if you read the book, pay attention in class, and treat the whole thing as sort of a game, things should be OK.",

Look to spend a lot of time on them, preferably in a group (this is encouraged by the professor).\n\nHis lecture style doesn;t help much.  He moves VERY quickly, but will always slow doown to answer questions.  The book sucks and doesn't help much at all.  You absolutely have to go to class and pay attention to even think about doing better than a B in this class.  I would recommend writing down all the examples, since the book doesn't begin to  tell you how to solve the homework problems.   Another pain in the ass is that the class met Mon Wed Fri, at 10am.\n\nLearn the material backwards and forwards.  The midterms are awful.  No numbers and no BS-ing your way through them.  Knowing the formulas is nowhere near enough.  They are the types of problems where only symbols are given and a number should magically pop out at the end as the answer.  The final is weird.  16 problems given in advance.  4 are chosen to be on the exam.  Basically by the exam time you had better have solved them all or found someone who has or else you are screwed.  You also have to know why your answer works.  Another hint: he chooses the trickiest problems to put on the exam.  Good luck, you're gonna need it.",

The key to succeeding in this class is probably being very thorough and being willing to spend time understanding what every assembly instruction does.

I hoped to strengthen my foundational knowledge, but I never anticipated how immersed we would become in broader concepts, computer systems for example. From the lectures, it was clear this course would be a deep dive\u2014connecting fundamental building blocks to real-world contexts. Looking back, it exceeded my expectations in every way, teaching me not only core principles but also how to apply them in practice.\n\nProfessor Timothy Paine\u2019s teaching style is both engaging and thorough. He is clearly passionate about the material, and that enthusiasm comes through in every lecture, lab, and discussion. He actively encourages questions, breaking down complex topics into manageable parts so students from all backgrounds can follow along. I personally asked a lot of questions, and he consistently provided comprehensive answers from multiple perspectives. Moreover, he pays close attention to individual interests, expanding on topics for those who want to delve deeper. Outside the classroom, his ample office hours and review sessions\u2014focusing on labs and broader real-world practices\u2014further demonstrate his dedication to student success.\n\nThe course content is carefully organized and strikes a perfect balance between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. Each lab assignment is crafted with practical applications in mind, making the learning process more tangible and immediately rewarding. By the end of the semester, I felt confident writing in C/C++ and even contributed to my research group\u2019s scientific tool development\u2014something I wouldn\u2019t have imagined at the outset. The grading was fair and transparent, supported by detailed rubrics that clearly laid out expectations and guided my growth. Overall, it was a supportive and dynamic environment, and I recommend this course to anyone seeking a solid understanding of data structures alongside practical programming skills.

I can't believe I wasted an entire semester's worth of time on such a disaster of a course, and it is beyond me how anyone could teach a course and call it \u201ceducation\u201d. \n\nGoing into this course, I thought that it would be an easy A. Past reviews of this course had said the same thing, except for one little detail: that Paine was NOT the professor. Paine\u2019s organizational skills and lectures are all over the place. One minute, you\u2019re learning about basic syntax, and the next you\u2019re asked to create an AI program to detect and predict future medical diagnostics. It\u2019s like Paine threw together random topics and created his syllabus by asking ChatGPT \u201cWhat should I teach in a Python course?\u201d. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s a complete disaster.\n\nAbout Paine himself: this person is the perfect example of boring and clueless. His teaching style is so dull and lifeless \u2014 it feels like he\u2019s trying to put the entire class to sleep. There\u2019s no passion, no engagement, nothing. It\u2019s like he actully couldn\u2019t care less about actually teaching the class. I find more excitement in cleaning my room than attending his lectures. No wonder less than 10 people in a 300 person lecture show up to class\u2026\n\nAt the beginning of the course, no grading details were posted on the syllabus. The same thing for the middle and at the end of the semester. Despite consistent questions if Paine could post a grading scheme on Ed Discussion, there\u2019s no response as Paine ghosts the entire class. And, as if things couldn\u2019t get any better, Paine releases the final grades ONLY THREE WEEKS after the grade submission due date. \n\nYou would think that the course wouldn\u2019t be graded so harshly. It\u2019s only an INTRODUCTORY class for FRESHMAN, so shouldn\u2019t the class at least be taught well? Wouldn\u2019t you expect Timothy Paine, a CS graduate from Columbia with SUMMA CUM LAUDE, to teach decently? And Paine says he can tutor CS for 300 DOLLARS PER HOUR on his website? You usually want someone with such accomplishments and connections to Columbia to teach a course you\u2019re taking \u2014 unfortunately, I think my dog could teach this course just as well as Paine. Rather than getting a Master\u2019s in Columbia\u2019s CS, a degree from the Teacher\u2019s College might be better suited for him. \n\nTo be honest, this is probably the worst learning experience I\u2019ve ever had. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this professor like COVID. ",

All notes are available on the course website or on the virtual machine and all the lectures on also virtual. Paine goes through the content thoroughly and takes lots of questions through out class.

One of my biggest complaints with other Columbia CS classes has been that they are very focused on the theory side. This class helped bring things down to earth. A lot of our work was based around what people actually *do* with CS--working with Git, creating libraries, contributing to other people's projects, working with documentation and formatting tools, etc. (As he mentions early on in the course, you can google most of the answers you need for this course. The class itself is more about knowing what you need to ask.) Personally, I felt like I gained a lot of important, tangible, practical skills, and basic knowledge that I had been lacking. Students with more experience would probably find it quite basic.\n\nPaine is a clear, friendly, and engaging lecturer. He's also extremely knowledgeable, and very approachable in office hours--students were using a wide variety of tools, processes, machines, etc, and he basically always knew how to help, or at least exactly where to look for more information. However, this also meant his lectures had a pretty dizzying array of possible tools and ways to do the same thing, which I found slightly overwhelming.",

                "content": "TL;DR: \r\n1. Boring material\r\n2. Not a good Professor\r\n3. Not very hard, grading is okay\r\n\r\nTook this class with Iddo Drori in spring 2020. While you may think that the pandemic is to blame for the poor review for this class, I beg to differ and have to argue that Iddo Drori himself is the ultimate culprit. \r\n\r\n1. Class: Iddo Drori is very monotone, and the lecture is incredibly boring. There is almost no participation from the students, and very limited engagement because Drori just keeps going on and on. Of course, people do ask questions, but he rarely gives satisfactory answers. When you ask a question, he will respond with one the followings: 1. \"I don't understand your question(and provides an irrelevant answer)\". 2. rudely says, if you just let him finish and gave him 2 more min, he would have covered your question. 3. high level stuff, and fails to explain in detail.\r\n\r\nI did not attend the lectures often because I found them not useful. I think more than half of the class is usually absent from the lecture. Half of those in attendance are doing their work and not paying attention. \r\n\r\n2. Iddo Drori is perhaps one of the worst CS professor at Columbia. He is one of the worst because he blatantly refuses to work with you, which in my opinion is unthinkable prior to this class. Imagine your boyfriend or girlfriend just refusing to talk you whenever you question him/her, and ghosts you. I do not understand why Drori acts the way he does, and he would literally ghost you when you question him hard. That means no replies in emails, canceling meetings/OH, etc. On projects, he offered absolutely no help whatsoever. The TAs provided so much help during the course, so if you do decide to take the class, ask the TAs. You may think interactions with the professor is not necessary, so this is fine, just remember that every interaction with Drori will give you a headache. He is unprofessional. \r\n\r\nThis experience(on him being a bad professor) is shared by many of my friends who have taken his class. \r\n\r\n3. Not very Hard: DL competition(s) and a semester long research project. You learn a lot during the process, as you would doing any project. As long as you do your work, grading is fairly lenient. (If you encounter any issues though, refer back to #2, no help from the Professor at all. Your project may or may not turn into something bigger with a potential to get published. In this case, it is a good opportunity, but the process will make you feel like you are a laborer for Drori. He offers no help at all(the only expertise he can provide is the logistics of research paper writing, like what parts are needed... formatting etc.), and getting papers published. \r\n\r\nIn closing, I would not recommend this class or professor. You would waste a lot of time...unless you just wanna aim for that paper publication? \r\n\r\nSome of you may think, so easy A? chill class? Not aiming for publication anyway? Still would not recommend.....Look elsewhere my dear friends, do yourself a favor. \r\n",

You'll get a broad sample of the current state of the field, but you won't practically learn how to implement anything aside from a basic neural network (from scratch) and CNN (using Tensorflow) (HWs 1 and 2) and whatever you decide to do for your final project. \r\n\r\nProfessor Drori is nice, but he's not great at explaining concepts in detail. Any time he attempted to delve into some of the math underlying the models we discussed (RL and GANs come to mind) things immediately became very unclear. You'll come out of this course with some handwavey knowledge of a few topics on the cutting edge of deep learning and possibly a cool project or area for further exploration if you chose a good final project topic.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course could have been much more valuable (we barely even learned to use Tensorflow), but I still did gain something from it. I wouldn't recommend the course with Drori, but if you're interested in deep learning and want a more structured intro to the field than just watching some videos online this is probably your only option. Though, to be honest it seems like everyone in the course learned everything they needed to for the HWs from Stanford cs231n videos anyway.",

Professor teaches it completely in a way as if you are already an expert in Deep Learning. Classes feels like as if the topics are just being revised (like they do during school days before exam). This course should be called Advanced Deep Learning  and prerequisite for this course is that you have already taken a deep learning course before. \r\n\r\nAfter few days, students literally stopped coming to classes as we realized that there is nothing to be learnt in class as most of the lecture is very high level and hard to grasp.\r\n\r\nAssignments:\r\nThere are 2 ridiculously heavy assignments. Expectation of the accuracy on the assignments it too high for any normal first time deep learning learner would feel. Instead of inspiring us to work on the assignments, they are made to demotivate you from taking any deep learning course ever. \r\n\r\nAlso, what the prof teaches in lecture is completely mathematical and what is asked in assignments is completely practical implementation of the stuff. You are expected to do everything on you own. \r\n\r\nProject:\r\nThen there is project which covers 80% of the marks. The expectation on project is so high that it alone will take you full semester. \r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\nDon't take this course unless you are too thorough in deep learning because it won't be taught in this class. \r\n",

For example, Prof Drinea taught us step-by-step methods for solving DP problems and proving reductions which made them much easier to grasp. \n\nShe is also a solid lecturer, although a bit of a fast talker, and did a great job of building each topic from the ground up. She also posed comprehension questions to the class during each lecture to make sure we were following. Her slides were also quite comprehensive and she gave detailed and quick responses to Ed posts.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this course- it is way more useful than trying to memorize solutions to Leetcode problems.

Unfortunately, her homework problems do not align with the material taught, she provides no review for the exams, allows no note sheet on the exams, and throws several questions in there which had nothing to do with what she recommended to study. \r\n\r\nIronically, for all her rhetoric on every homework about using only the book and lecture material (i.e. no outside research), if you Google her problems you can find she herself has plagiarized them from other sources, which explains why they don't sync up with her lectures well.  In all, I thought the lectures were interesting, but this could have been a far better course as her methods were ingenuous and designed to set students up for failure.  She does curve, but expect a C if you're not strong in theory and proofs.  ",

                "content": "Professor Drinea is a solid pick for Algorithms I and she has taught for the past two spring semesters. Here is what you are in for:\r\n\r\nLecture--\r\nProfessor Drinea is an okay lecturer. I had some trouble understanding her sometimes because of her accent and the fact that she is somewhat soft spoken. This was exacerbated by the horrible acoustics of the classroom (Mudd 833). That being said, she is quite good at explaining things, though you will need to review some content afterwards (as well as do some reading prior to lecture) to learn the maximum amount. All slides are posted on the course wiki.\r\n\r\nContent--\r\nWe covered a ton of content this semester (and according to my roommate, more than most Algorithms I classes cover). This included increased coverage in Linear Programming, P/NP Reductions, and a bit of Approximations. There was also a hackathon early in the semester that went over applications of various algorithms for those of you who are more programming focused.\r\n\r\nHomeworks--\r\n6 assignments that ranged from really easy (graph algorithm pset) to crazily difficult (dynamic programming pset). They are due every two weeks.\r\n\r\nExams--\r\nClosed book midterm and final. Midterm was incredibly long and difficult. Final was more reasonable length, but still pretty difficult. Averages were pretty low.\r\n\r\nOffice Hours--\r\nTA office hours are a mixed bag. Sometimes TAs don't know the answer to questions or have trouble explaining it. Being able to speak Chinese with them is actually a huge plus. Professor Drinea is very helpful in her office hours, so definitely go to her. On the whole, these are very important for succeeding in the class (unless you are absolutely brilliant).\r\n\r\nGrading--\r\nVery reasonable. I slacked the first half of class and finally picked up my game in the latter half (went to OHs and lecture). After all was said and done, my scores were a tick below the mean and I ended up with a B, so the curve appears to be the standard B/B+ for mean. ",

You get tested on everything he says in class, NOT what's in the reading, so the best strategy is to NOT do the readings but instead write down everything he says and memorize it in time for the final. Also write a rough draft of your essays in time to have them reviewed by the TAs before they're due. If you can choose between Adam Blazej and Jake McNulty as TAs I recommend Adam because he's an easier essay grader and he gives out study guides for the midterms (however these study guides don't include EVERYTHING that will appear on the midterm.)

After everything I had read on Culpa, I thought this intro class would be quite good, even enjoyable.  Boy, was I mistaken.  All other reviews notwithstanding, this professor clearly has absolutely no interest in teaching this course currently.  This is a shame, as I had spoken directly to two of his previous students who raved about him, and can see where it would be interesting subject matter if I didn't have to literally teach it to myself with the help of a tutor (which I pay for out of my own pocket).\r\n\r\nThe major problem is that Professor Morrison doesn't teach.  He distributes slides before class, then posts the slides up on a projector and reads them, word for word, to the class.  When he's done reading, class is over, which usually occurs about 40 minutes early.  Class that's scheduled to last for 80 minutes usually ends in about 35-40 minutes.  While many students might think it's great to get out early, I would prefer to actually be taught the material and the methods behind doing things like proofs, not have someone read me his slides verbatim then slip out when class is barely half over.  He does ask before he concludes if anyone has any questions, but is generally met with blank stares, so takes this as meaning everyone magically absorbed the material he just read to them.\r\n\r\nHe does offer review time in class before each exam, which is probably the only time the classes run closer to their full scheduled time.  This is quite helpful, but it's difficult to review practice questions when you have no idea how to do a proof.  His mantra is \"to get comfortable with proofs you have to practice them about 1000 times.\"  That's terrific, but I wouldn't exactly be able to sit down at the piano to practice Chopin if I had never been taught how to read the music.\r\n\r\nThe TAs hold \"office hours\" 2x/week (in cafeteria lounges with loud music and TVs on the walls), and a review session prior to each exam, but are not required to attend the classes, so if you ask them a question about something that was presented in class, they have no context.\r\n\r\nGiven the previous reviews, I can only think there is something else the professor is currently focused on.  Upcoming tenure, publishing a book, I'm not sure, but whatever it is, his focus certainly is not on this class, and at a tuition cost per-student in excess of $4000, that's not exactly good value for my money.\r\n\r\nIf you have a philosophy, mathematics or cs background, you'll probably be in good shape for this class.

You receive almost full credit just for submitting the file, even if it's wrong (8 out of 10 points), but if you want to learn the material in the course, the homework is extremely important to do correctly. I have no problem investing hours doing my homework, but do have a problem wasting time with bad software.\r\n\r\nLastly, several of the more time consuming homework problems don't map to the material covered on exams, so are pretty much a time-consuming waste of time.\r\n\r\nThe workload and level of difficulty ramp up significantly from the first exam to the last.

Homeworks are recommended to be done concurrently with lecture, but are only due before the test which covers that material, so it's possible to only submit the HWs right before those tests and get full credit.\r\n\r\nThe exams are heavily based on the lectures. Morrison's lectures are concise and clear, and are very focused on definitions. For example, with each new term you learn like \"tautological consequence\" you'd have a definition of the term, then examples in which it is applied in potential problems. Exams take the potential problems that are found in these lecture notes and either repeat them or expand on them. For this semester, the first two midterms had questions that were simpler than or equivalent to the practice problems, while the final featured two \"advanced\" problems that were decently difficult (even though we had received advanced practice problems).\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a class in which you can undoubtedly get an A. I did not attend lectures, but just by studying all of the lecture notes & understanding the definitions, then doing all practice problems provided, found it quite easy to ace every test. I expect that people who didn't do well either:\r\n\r\nA) Underestimated the need to study - while logic is often intuitive, you can't take it for granted that you'll be able to solve problems. Without studying you could definitely have done poorly on the tests as doing the practice problems helped me gain an intuition on how to solve certain puzzles; also, in a logic test, you can't BS at all.\r\n\r\nB) Fell behind and didn't review to make it up - the entire course does build on itself so it's important to go through all the lecture notes and understand everything. People tend to do decently well on the tests, so even missing one question may bump you down a fair bit. Note that an A+ is possible but quite difficult to achieve even if you score well on everything.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the ambition of this course is truly its name: it is NOT complex; for anyone who's taken Symbolic Logic, that course is way more difficult. Morrison does a good job of providing clear and helpful notes and enough studying makes an A achievable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He's very approachable, and if you have any questions at all you can meet with him in his office hours. He makes lots of endearing jokes (which aren't always funny. but that's why they're awesome). Also, he's so enthusiastic about everything! He really loves what he's doing, especially when we get to Spinoza (which is his favorite). \r\n\r\nnext: the TAs. I had Mark as a TA and he is FANTASTIC. his discussion sections were really interesting. He's so smart and explains even the toughest concepts in a way that everyone will understand. He's a very very fair grader- he wants you to do well! Meet with him in office hours to go over the paper topics and fine tune your arguments.Also the day he lectured the class confirmed that he will make an amazing professor one day.\r\n\r\nand finally: the class.

Trust me, trust me, it's worth it to do both. The material is interesting, and the lectures are enjoyable. It's a good way to get introduced to philosophy, or John is a great professor to have when you are finishing up your philosophy major requirements. ",

There were tons of GS students in this class though he told them all to get out the first day because he wanted to focus on the pleibs. ie. freshman. But they didnt and therefore the class got kind of confusing. You must go to all the lectures because you'll find it hard to understand the slides without his explanation of his examples. He makes TONS of inside jokes/examples to himself and to those in the class who watch whatever shows he watches.  I liked the class it just and him as a teacher but I think the class size may have hindered the material. Because the class is basically like geometry proofs minus the geometry it think it would have been more helpful if he had made his office hours more clear. The TA's were the ones who taught you it if you didnt get something but because its a proof that can be attacked from many different angles, it became hard to see how JoMo wanted you to articulate the proof. \r\n\r\nYou also have to buy a 120$ book that MUST BE NEW bc it comes with a CD that MUST BE NEW because it registers you and your answers via an internet connection. If your computer craps out frequently before class when you're doing your HW your'e screwed. You only get to drop 4 HW (you get hw everyday) and if you average above an 80 it can bring your grade up somewhat. This semester he curved all tests but the final.\r\n\r\nGrade Recieved: B",

                "content": "I took this course after the Computer Graphics course, which I absolutely loved.  I had some expectation that the animation course would similarly involve quite a bit of physics and math, and I wasn't disappointed in this respect.  The bulk of the grade comes from assignments broken up into themes and milestones.  There is an assignment every week, with the implementation of basic gravitational and spring forces, collision detection, time integration using the explicit and implicit Euler methods, rigid bodies, and finishing up with fluid simulation. We did not get to the final assignment because there was a lot of difficulty getting the preceding ones done in time and the deadlines had to be extended nearly every week. \n\nI attended a few of Professor Zheng's lectures, and while I had no complaints with his teaching style, I just didn't find them to be wholly necessary because the handouts that come with each assignment are so thorough, you pretty much just need to read and re-read them to be able to complete the assignments.  This is not to say that any of the assignments are easy, however.  There are test cases that must be passed, and it's very easy to fail them even when your animation looks correct because of small residuals.  Unfortunately, there is also no partial credit, as the assignments are graded by an autograder.  You either pass the tests with no residuals or your score suffers.  There were a lot of complaints in the class because of this, and it made it probably one of if not the most challenging courses I've taken at Columbia.  I easily spent 30+ hours each week on the assignments.  Many involve math derivations and tons of debugging to get the program running properly and passing the test cases.  One involves devising your own algorithm as part of a contest, reading research papers for some ideas.  This was perhaps the most difficult assignment, and my own implementation using bounding boxes worked fine on individual test cases but couldn't scale up with thousands of particles, so I only got partial credit.\n\nDespite the difficulty and the very short turnaround time on the assignments, I felt very gratified by the end of the semester at having completed everything.  The course has a level of rigor you don't often see and I feel the struggle taught me a lot.  In terms of math, you should be familiar with linear algebra and taking second-order partial derivatives.  Make sure you read each of the handouts for the assignments thoroughly and many times as you work through them.  There are tips, hints, and just general information you will need to know to successfully complete everything and get your programs running.  All assignments are done in C++, the same as the graphics course, so you will need to be familiar with it.  The Ed discussion forum was not very active, but the few people who were on there helped each other out.  The TAs for the class were fantastic as well, sharing very useful tips and derivations to be able to complete some of the assignments.  Overall, I would definitely recommend the course if you're up for a challenge and really want to learn the physics and math that go into creating animation.  The simulations you'll be running are very rudimentary, but seeing your work come to life gives you some idea of what can be done at a more advanced level in this field.",

You will need to start each milestone basically the day it comes out in order to have a chance of finishing it and passing the tests of the autograder. I don't think the grading is entirely fair, as one can have a working program that gives a roughly correct animated simulation, but there can be residuals that cause the tests to fail and no partial credit given.  I also think the assignments should be extended out to 1-1/2 weeks at minimum to complete, as they are so involved and require so much debugging that you essentially need to work on them every day of the week for multiple hours to have a chance of finishing on time.  Every deadline was extended, and we even had an assignment due during the week of Spring Break.  The work was unrelenting and there were multiple complaints on the discussion forum.  I enjoyed the milestones a lot, so it wasn't a big deal for me personally, but it was definitely stressful and frustrating at times not being able to complete an assignment to my satisfaction because I simply ran out of time."

                "content": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It singlehandedly made me question taking the Vision/Graphics track as a CS Major.\n\nWhile the content of the class that resides at the intersection of computer science, physics, and applied math sounds very compelling, the structuring of the assignments takes away heavily from that appeal. For one thing, the assignments had hidden skeleton code for some mysterious reason that I honestly still don't understand to this day that makes it harder to understand what each of the functions do. Towards the start of the semester, that in combination with the lack of commenting/documentation made the assignments more of a hassle than they really could've (and should've been). \n\nThen, some of the assignments involved reading research papers that were so heavily disjointed from each other to the point of again, making the assignments harder than they could've and should've been. An example that comes to mind is the T2M3 assignment (Theme 2, Milestone 3), where we had to implement an algorithm for particle collision detections that was more efficient than quadratic (O(N^2)) time complexity. For that assignment, only one of the algorithms were fast and accurate enough in actuality to pass the test cases - all of the others (including the ones actually mentioned in the recommended research papers) were obsolete. I spent days implementing one of them, just for it to fail all of the test cases.\n\nThere were other assignments that were just freakishly hard because of the time taken to complete them being heavily padded by complex derivations, namely T2M2. The one equation that involved vector arithmetic in combination with algebra took me several hours to derive, just for it to be incorrect, where I had to go back in and spend even more hours re-deriving it, just for it to still be incorrect. I eventually just had to leave that assignment unfinished, just like 2 others out of the 10 we've been given to do.\n\nLastly, the final involved doing derivations by hand, which I feel EXTREMELY weary about given T2M2. It's also such a departure from the work we had otherwise spent doing during the semester, to the point where my hopes aren't very high for how it'll end.\n\nIf you're seeing this, you're likely not following the Vision/Graphics track as a CS Major, as it would've been out-of-phase in lieu of the new \"general\" track. And in that case, I heavily recommend doing yourself a favor and take any other class.",
